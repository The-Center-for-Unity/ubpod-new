        "summary": "One aspect of God that anyone can grasp is the fact of God’s personality. We may not understand it in its fullness, but we can be assured that whatever our understanding of the personality of God, he cannot be anything less than the concept that we are able to grasp. God can know and be known, love and be loved just as any person can know and love another. As Jesus once said to Thomas, \"It matters little what idea of the Father you may entertain as long as you are spiritually acquainted with the ideal of his infinite and eternal nature.\"\nWe can see the personality of God in his Creator Sons. Jesus of Nazareth is the perfect example of someone who told us that when we had seen him, we had seen the Father. Through his life, he revealed the personality of God.\nIt is the personality of God that reveals his unity. Personality is spread throughout the universe, but it is centered in the Universal Father, who IS personality. If we deny God’s personality, we are left with the concepts of either materialism or pantheism; however, a progressing personality mediated by mind and spirit transcends both of these concepts."

        "summary": "In mid-August, 7 BCE, Joseph prepared to go to Bethlehem to register for a census of Herod’s kingdom for taxation purposes. Mary insisted on accompanying him. They set off from Nazareth, with Mary riding on a donkey while Joseph walked. When they reached Bethlehem, due to a lack of available rooms, they found lodging in a cleaned-up stable below an overcrowded inn. Mary was weary and asked Joseph to stay with her instead of enrolling immediately. The next day, on August 21st, 7 BCE, Mary gave birth to Jesus. A few weeks later, priests from Mesopotamia, guided by a dream, arrived in Bethlehem and left gifts with Mary for the baby. The legend of the star of Bethlehem originated from an astronomical event involving the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, but later generations turned it into a myth surrounding the birth of Jesus.\nMany weeks after Jesus’ birth, Joseph and Mary went to the temple in Jerusalem to present their baby to the priests, redeem him, and perform the purification ceremony. Simeon and Anna, who were close to the priest Zacharias, had all conspired to dramatize the event. Anna had written a stirring poem that Simeon sang proclaiming Jesus a child of promise, surprising Joseph, Mary, and others present. Joseph and Mary were overwhelmed by this public event.\nAfter the visit of the priests of Ur to Bethlehem, Herod became suspicious and summoned them for questioning. Unsatisfied with their explanation, he sent them to find the child and report back. Meanwhile, Herod's informers brought him news of the event in the temple but failed to follow Joseph and Mary. Herod, growing angry, demanded the child be brought to him, but failing to find him after a year of searching, he ruthlessly ordered all male babies in Bethlehem under two years old be killed. Joseph and Mary, warned by a member of Herod’s court and believer in the coming Messiah, fled the night before the massacre occurred to Alexandria in Egypt with Jesus, where they stayed for two years before returning to Bethlehem."

        "summary": "Understanding Jesus' expectations of this long-awaited pilgrimage to Jerusalem helps you gain a better insight into Jesus' reactions to the entire experience. On one hand, everything he had ever imagined Jerusalem and the temple to be in regards to the awe and beauty of the material grounds, buildings, and the city of Jerusalem did not disappoint. There were also some unexpected thrills during his visit, but much of the behavior of the people during his experience at the temple disappointed him to the very core of his being. The visit of a celestial being during this journey ended up serving as a reminder and challenge to him – a confirmation of his purpose and consecration of his will to seek to do the heavenly Father’s will.\nLiving in Nazareth, with the liberal interpretation of the rabbis, allowed him to interact with gentiles and had prepared Jesus somewhat for what he was about to encounter; but Jesus had been sheltered from the corrupt, commercial aspect of the temple proceedings in Jerusalem. This young, sensitive soul was about to encounter one of the great shocks of his life, and the opportunity to experience a better understanding of the world as it existed in first-century Palestine.\nDuring the Passover week, Jesus kept his place and listened attentively to the discussions. Upon its conclusion, Joseph and Mary mistakenly left Jesus behind. He remained at the temple, engaging scholars with his wisdom. When they found him days later, he calmly explained his purpose and pledged to be obedient to both his heavenly and earthly fathers. Jesus' time at the temple allowed him to shine and left a lasting impression on those who heard him speak."

        "summary": "When Jesus was 31 years old, in 25 CE, he completed his final tour through the heart of Palestine as a private citizen. At the end of this tour, Jesus was led by his indwelling spirit to Mount Hermon, where he spent six weeks alone with God. The purpose of this journey was for Jesus to complete the mastery of his human mind and fully consecrate himself to the remainder of his lifework on earth.\nIt was an unusual time in Jesus’ life and was similar to the subsequent period of forty days that he spent on Mount Hermon just after his baptism (in January of 26 CE) that inaugurated the divine phase of Jesus' earthly career. That period has become associated with the so-called \"great temptation\" of Jesus, but in fact, those events happened on Mount Hermon in the preceding year.\nNear the end of this sojourn, Jesus asked his heavenly Father if he could have a conference with the rebels who had instigated the planetary rebellion. He wanted to confront them as himself, the human Jesus. His request was granted, and these rebels were made visible to him. This meeting between Jesus, Caligastia (our rebellious Planetary Prince), and Satan (Lucifer’s representative) took place in the last week of Jesus’ sojourn. Our Biblical records portray this meeting as the \"Great Temptation of Jesus.\""

Herod's paranoia led to a massacre of male infants, prompting Joseph and Mary to flee to Egypt with Jesus. After returning home, Jesus grew up in a loving and learning environment. He developed intellectually and spiritually, engaging in deep conversations and questioning various subjects. Jesus assumed increasing responsibilities within his family, especially after the death of his father at age 14, shouldering the financial burden and caring for his widowed mother and eight siblings.\nAs Jesus matured, he balanced his family duties with a growing awareness of his divine mission. He studied different cultures and engaged with people from diverse backgrounds. Throughout his twenties, Jesus embarked on journeys, both within Palestine and beyond, learning, teaching, and deepening his understanding of human nature. He maintained humility, focusing on his spiritual purpose rather than seeking worldly recognition. In his late twenties, he took a Mediterranean tour, conducted a caravan, returned to Nazareth, and volunteered for another journey. These experiences exposed him to various peoples and cultures and refined his understanding of his divine mission.\nAt age 31, Jesus declared that his time had come, and this marked the beginning of his public ministry and the fulfillment of his Father's will. Jesus, along with his brothers James and Jude, was baptized by John the Baptist. As Jesus emerged from the water, a voice proclaimed him as the beloved Son of God. Following his baptism, Jesus secluded himself for forty days. Upon his return, he began assembling his apostles, selecting twelve men to carry on his work after his departure."

Little known to the modern world, Jesus became a skilled harpist by age eleven and enjoyed entertaining his family, friends, and neighbors with his beautiful music during the evenings, especially in the winter months. Jesus also promoted an interest in vocal music among his friends. Music was a way for Jesus to express himself and bring joy to others.\nWhen he was fifteen years old, a tax collector threatened to confiscate his harp to extract additional revenue. In Jesus' nineteenth year, he sold his harp to secure the funds to send his brother Jude to school. This was a willing sacrifice Jesus made to care for his father Joseph's family. But the loss of the harp took away a source of joy and comfort that Jesus cherished during his mortal life. Even so, Jesus found solace in other ways. In later years he would often go to a hill he loved as a child and reminisce about his childhood days in Nazareth. These memories helped him find strength and prepared him for the challenges that were ahead.\nJesus' love for music and his skill with the harp were a part of his life and this can make him feel closer and more accessible, reminding us that he lived a life filled with many of the same passions and pleasures that enrich our own experiences during our lives."

        "summary": "The Indwelling Spirit of God, a divine presence that resides within every human mind, is a spirit gift from the Universal Father and constantly strives to lead human beings to God and to help them personally know God. The Spirit sets spiritual standards that are the basis for personality survival, and those who submit to its guidance are led towards God. The kingdom of God is within every person through this spirit presence, and religious faith enables individuals to bridge the gap between intellectual logic and spiritual affirmations of the soul. The spirit indwelling within the human mind reveals the Father-source of all that is true, beautiful, and good. Three separate pieces of evidence of the Spirit's indwelling in the human mind are humanitarian fellowship (love), interpretation of the universe (wisdom), and spiritual evaluation of life (worship).\nThe Indwelling Spirit can be understood as a kind of inner voice or intuition that guides us towards spiritual truths. Following the guidance of the Indwelling Spirit is seen as essential for living a meaningful and fulfilling life. Although the Universal Father lives at the center of all things in the universe, God is not distant or inaccessible, but rather present within us and he can be communicated with through prayer, meditation, and worship. The Spirit provides a rich and complex vision of the nature of God and is a fragment of the infinite consciousness of the Universal Father that lives within each of us."

The foundation of the soul is the individual’s moral consciousness, and it is this moral self-consciousness that determines the potential for eternal survival of the soul. The soul exists and grows only in relation to moral thinking and spiritual progress. If the soul stops growing, it dies.\nProgress in soul growth is aided by the Thought Adjuster, the literal presence of God in the mind. The Thought Adjuster comes to dwell in the mind of every individual at the time of that individual’s first moral choice, usually at about five years of age. The coming of the Adjuster signifies the birth of the soul, but the soul is distinct from the indwelling spirit.\nOver a lifetime, the growth of the soul is either helped or hindered by the moral choices made by the individual. This moral consciousness is evolutionary and improves with experience. The closer the alliance between the moral consciousness and the indwelling adjuster, the more the soul grows and the surer the possibility of eternal survival of that soul. All conflict requiring choice has to do with maintaining harmony between the intellectual consciousness and the moral consciousness."

The fact that Jesus arose on the third day and subsequently appeared in a different form to nearly one thousand eyewitnesses over the next forty days was indeed an astonishing occurrence.\nJesus’ resurrection was accomplished through the inherent power in himself; no other personality assisted him.

Shortly after his burial, certain celestial personalities gathered to discuss a possible means of restoring their Master to life. But the celestial being Gabriel advised them that the means to bring the Creator back to life was up to Jesus alone. And then Jesus’ glorified indwelling spirit spoke further words of advice that echoed that of Gabriel. And so, this group of archangels and others whose job it was to participate in such mortal rehabilitation adjourned and awaited further developments.\nOn April 9, 30 CE, Jesus resurrected from the tomb in a form that was not material, yet not fully spiritual. He was made visible in this form to nearly one thousand people in nineteen separate appearances before he left earth.\nThe material body of Jesus remained in the tomb, undisturbed, when Jesus resurrected in semi-spirit form. The large stone in front of the tomb remained in place. Not wishing to witness the slow decay of the body of their Master, the chief of archangels requested of Gabriel that they be given custody of his human body and he granted their request. In order to remove the body, the stone was rolled away and the body of Jesus was returned to its elements, a return of the \"dust to dust.\" And this was accomplished by bypassing the element of time, so that the material body instantaneously decomposed."

        "summary": "In 29 CE, Jesus made a groundbreaking announcement that astounded both his disciples and the community around him. He declared that he would choose ten devout women to be dedicated to the ministerial work of the kingdom. These women had listened to the teachings given to the young evangelists, but they never imagined that Jesus would commission them to teach the gospel and care for the sick.\nThis proclamation by Jesus was nothing short of an emancipation proclamation, liberating women from spiritual inferiority forever. Men were no longer to view women as lesser beings in the realm of religion and spirituality. While Jesus had previously declared the equality of all as children of God, this formal commissioning of women as religious teachers and allowing them to travel with the group was a radical step.\nThis event had a profound impact on the nation, with both supporters and enemies of Jesus taking notice. The women remained dedicated to their mission, gaining the approval of many, including the apostles who initially embraced this liberation of women's roles. The women's corps grew in strength and expanded their ministry, training an additional fifty women in home visitation and caring for the sick and afflicted."

Jesus established a women's corps and had unwavering support from women who followed him. He exemplified high ideals and treated all people, including women, with love, fairness, and respect.\nJesus' first declaration of his divinity was to Nalda, the Samaritan woman at the well. He was not a person who would prefer men over women. He defended women who were being taken advantage of. Unfairness to women aroused his indignation. Jesus was fully supportive of women serving the new revelation of the gospel of the kingdom and working publicly alongside the men at a time in history when it was almost impossible to do. Jesus helped educate his sisters when girls were not allowed to go to school. Jesus' own mother was a well-educated woman for her time and Jesus saw the discrimination of women as being wrong.

Her parents were Joachim and Hannah, and she had two sisters and two brothers. She was a descendant of a long line of remarkable women, including Eve and Ruth. Her ancestry is characterized by the predominance of strong but average individuals. In culture and belief, Mary was a Jew, but in heredity her lineage was Syrian, Hittite, Phoenician, Greek, and Egyptian.\nMary was a brown-eyed, nearly blond woman. Her family was well educated, and she was far better educated than most women of her day. Mary developed a talent for planning and the ability to adapt and execute her plans. She was an expert weaver and skilled in most of the household arts of her day; she grew to be a good housekeeper and a superior homemaker. She was usually a cheerful person with a sunny disposition; she freely and frequently indulged in emotional expression.\nMary married a craftsman named Joseph, a man from a good family. Not long after they were wed, in November of 8 BCE, Mary was visited by a celestial being named Gabriel who announced she was to become the mother of a \"child of promise.\" This announcement came as a shock, and she said nothing to anyone for many weeks. When she knew without a doubt that she was pregnant, she told Joseph. But Joseph was skeptical until he had a dream that coincided with Gabriel’s announcement. Soon, Mary and Joseph came to believe they were to be the parents of an expected one, a Messiah who had long been foretold by Jewish prophets. Nine months after Gabriel’s visit Joshua (Jesus) was born, on August 21, 7 BCE."

        "summary": "Life can sometimes seem unfair and challenging. It is natural to wonder why we face difficult situations. The truth is, we live in an imperfect and evolving world that is designed to provide each of us with free will and the ability to choose between good and evil. This freedom is vital for gaining experience and learning, even if it means that we will be confronted with unfair life situations. However, it is important to remember that we are not alone in facing these challenges. Throughout history, many people have also experienced unfairness and adversity. Even Jesus faced many difficult situations during his time on earth.\nUnfairness and suffering are not punishments from God. God loves each and every one of us unconditionally. He does not cause our suffering, but he can help us find strength and meaning in the midst of it. We can find comfort in knowing that God is always with us. He understands our pain and is ready to offer us guidance, comfort, and strength. Through prayer and seeking a personal relationship with God, we can find solace and the ability to overcome life's challenges. It is a well-known fact that people grow in strength of character when rising to the challenges of adversity.\nBecause we live in a world of time and space where we have the freedom to make choices, sometimes the choices we make, or the choices made by others, can affect us in negative ways. We are equally faced with challenges created by living life in the midst of an imperfect world. Remember that even in the face of unfair situations, we have the power to choose how we respond. We can choose to grow stronger, to show kindness and compassion, and to seek justice. By doing so, we can make a difference in the world and bring about positive change."

Today, scientific reasoning prevails where superstition once reigned. While accidents are inevitable in a world governed by free will and natural law, they can also lead to personal growth and societal progress.\nGod could prevent accidents, but doing so would undermine human free will and the opportunity for growth through experience.

When we become angry, it is like throwing a stone into a hornet's nest – it stirs up trouble and creates chaos. Anxiety and fear were common among our early ancestors. These feelings helped them survive and adapt to their environment. However, excessive anxiety can be harmful, leading to anger and inhibiting our progress. It is important to find a balance and not let anger control us or cause harm to others.\nAnger is a sign of our spiritual nature losing control over our thoughts and actions. It shows a lack of love, self-respect, and self-control. Anger can harm our health, cloud our minds, and hinder our spiritual growth. Remembering the teachings of love and patience can help us overcome anger and find peace within ourselves. Our ancestors were quite aggressive and prone to war in the early days of humanity. Later, humanity was taught the golden rule – to treat others as they would like to be treated. When they lived by this code, they were able to avoid violent conflicts and valued peace and harmony. More recently, Jesus entreated us to love one another as he loved us, which is the highest love and tolerance the world has ever known.\nLet your heart be so dominated by love that your spirit guide will have little trouble in delivering you from the tendency to give vent to those outbursts of animal anger that are inconsistent with the status of divine sonship.

His profound love sparks a reciprocal response in human hearts, demonstrating that love is contagious and eternally creative. His teachings elevate righteousness above mere technicalities of right and wrong. Unlike mercy, which sets aside guilt, love eradicates sin and its resulting weaknesses. Jesus introduces a transformative way of living, encouraging goodness that effectively overcomes evil without resistance. His forgiveness goes beyond condonation; it signifies salvation from condemnation, correcting wrongs, and ensuring eternal rehabilitation through divine love.\nThrough his personal love, Jesus liberates individuals and empowers them to choose better paths.

In Islam, Melchizedek is associated with Khidr, with expectations of his return as a righteous judge unveiling divine mysteries after the resurrection of the dead."

        "summary": "The last eight years of Jesus’ life were a training period for his believers, beginning in April of 22 CE, with a tour around the Mediterranean. On that tour, he taught individuals he sought out in Rome and other stops along the way. In January of 26 CE, he began training groups of men and women in his homeland, Palestine. These two phases of training, private and public, created a foundation for the religion about Jesus that came into being following his death.\nJesus’ training method was fourfold, he taught by example, by question and answer, by actual experience, and by parables. Jesus lived his sublime teachings and that was perhaps his most effective way of training his apostles and disciples. But he was also feared for what he taught and the miracles he performed. The religious authorities were afraid of a divine being claiming to be a \"Son of man and a Son of God,\" someone with such power. He paid with his life for his words and deeds. Despite this resistance, his teachings lived on in those he so thoroughly trained, the many messengers who adored him and carried his saving gospel to the world."

His fame had spread and his message of repentance and baptism was very popular throughout all Palestine. Jesus spoke favorably of John and his message and this inspired the Zebedee brothers – John and James – to present themselves to John for baptism. And they kept Jesus apprised of John’s evangelical activities.\nIn January of 26 CE, Jesus’ brothers James and Jude, approached Jesus to discuss whether they should go to John for baptism, too. After a night of meditation and prayer, Jesus announced that his hour had come and told his brothers that the three of them would leave immediately for John’s encampment.\nAt noon on Monday, January 14, 26 CE, Jesus, along with his brothers, was baptized in the Jordan River by John the Baptist. It was a momentous occasion during which the group of four men standing in the water – Jesus, James, Jude, and John the Baptist – experienced a celestial voice that said \"This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.\""

But he was also followed everywhere he went by people who wanted him to heal them or their sick relatives or friends. On March 27, he decided that he desperately needed a break from the crowds. He and the apostles planned to row across the lake unnoticed. But the multitudes did notice, and thousands followed him on that day and the following three days. By Wednesday, March 30, more than five thousand people had gathered in this large park.\nBy the third day, food began to be an issue, as most people had not brought enough. Even the provisions that Jesus and the apostles had brought along were dwindling by this time. Rumors were going around that Jesus was going to use this spot to declare himself the king of the Jews, and the crowd was in a state of anticipation.\nOn Wednesday, Jesus asked that the apostolic food be brought to him and, after organizing the large multitude in groups, he began to hand out food to the apostles who carried it to the evangelists and then into the crowd. By the end of the day, five thousand people had been miraculously fed from the apostolic stores of five barley loaves and two fishes. There were twelve baskets of food left over after everyone was fed, which were collected by the disciples."

They arrived before noon on Monday, August 15, and around three o'clock, Jesus left the three apostles, telling them that he was going to go off by himself to commune with the heavenly Father and his messengers. When he returned, they ate a small supper together and the three apostles fell asleep, only to be awoken by a strange sound. They then saw Jesus talking with two beings who were glowing with celestial light. They spoke in a strange language. Peter had the idea that the two beings were Moses and Elijah. But in truth, these beings were Gabrial and Father Melchizedek.\nWhen the vision faded, Peter told Jesus that he would like for them all to stay and that they could put up tents for Jesus and his associates. But even as he spoke, a silvery cloud came and surrounded them all. And then they heard a voice saying: \"This is my beloved Son; give heed to him.\" The cloud vanished, and Jesus and the three apostles were alone again on the mountain. Jesus reached down and touched the three and told them not to be afraid. And soon after midnight, they started down the mountain together. On the way down, Jesus told them that they were not to tell anyone about their experience on the mountain until after he had risen from the dead."

Instead of immediately going to him, and knowing that Lazarus would die that very night, Jesus decided to wait until there would be no doubt that Lazarus had truly died. Jesus decided to use Lazarus’ death to perform a spectacular demonstration of his divine power – a miracle that would be a signal to his enemies of the love of the Father and Jesus’ undisputable power over life and death and evidence that he truly was the Son of God. He hoped that this demonstration would inspire them to finally accept him and his teachings\nAfter four days, on March 2, 30 CE, Jesus and his apostles arrived at Lazarus’ home where he was received by Lazarus’ grieving sisters. He assured them that all was well, and went to Lazarus' tomb, where Jesus prayed and commanded Lazarus to come forth. Lazarus came back to life, still wrapped in his grave cloths. Jesus told the people to free Lazarus, but some were frightened and ran away; Lazarus didn't remember anything that had happened, and was confused about why he had awakened in the garden. Jesus reassured Lazarus and explained that this would happen to all who believed in him. Though many people came to believe in Jesus as a result of his amazing work, others only hardened their hearts to reject him even more."

He advocates that marriage is a civil institution, evolved through human history, not a sacrament, and emphasizes the importance of parental roles in the nurturing and spiritual growth of children.\nWhile addressing the issue of divorce, Jesus advocated for it as a necessary societal function to prevent worse outcomes, rejecting the notion of marriage’s divine indissolubility and emphasizing equality in marital dissolution. His teachings suggest that divorce, though not ideal, must be managed with realistic approaches and mutual effort, promoting fairness and the well-being of all parties involved.\nRearing children is essential for all, contributing significantly to both the child's spiritual development and the parents' growth, shaping their journey and relationship with the divine.

It reveals a profound divine paradox - rather than hoarding power, the Universal Father constantly gives away every possible aspect of Himself, sharing authority and divinity with His created beings while maintaining cosmic unity through the Trinity. This concept challenges our usual ideas about supreme beings and presents a model of divine leadership based on generosity and shared power rather than control."

        "summary": "In a pivotal gathering of over 60 believers in Jerusalem, Jesus appears in his morontia form to deliver a powerful wake-up call about the true meaning of his teachings. He lovingly but firmly challenges his followers for being surprised by his death and resurrection when he had prepared them for it, while reinforcing his core message: that all humans are children of God and can personally experience this profound truth through living faith. This appearance marks a crucial transition as Jesus prepares his followers to carry forward his message without his physical presence."

Arriving at the expected location, Jesus had already left with the apostles, causing Judas to fear their retaliation. He went to Gethsemane instead and requested a company of forty armed soldiers from the Jewish rulers. After facing obstacles, they obtained permission from Pilate and, accompanied by over sixty individuals, including armed soldiers and temple guards, Judas set out to arrest Jesus.\nTheir arrival at Gethsemane aroused the apostles, who headed to where Jesus was sitting alone in the moonlight. The apostles approached from one side and Judas and the armed soldiers approached from the other side. Judas stepped out in front, hoping that he could identify Jesus quickly and the arrest could be made with little fuss. But Jesus stepped up and asked the guards who they wanted before Judas could reach him. He immediately identified himself as the one they were looking for.\nJudas could have stopped there and not carried out his betrayal, but he needed to carry out his bargain with the rulers who were going to pay him. So he embraced Jesus and placed a kiss on his face. It was a shocking scene. Jesus once again asked the soldiers who they were looking for, and again he identified himself as the one they wanted. He told them he was ready to go with them."

        "summary": "To appreciate the meaning of the death on the cross, you must first consider the meaning of the life Jesus lived. Jesus desired to live a mortal life in the flesh to gain a full and sympathetic understanding of the intense struggle mankind must endure; and to reveal the true, loving nature of our heavenly Father. He championed the cause of living the perfect will of God – and he became the pinnacle of what is humanly possible – what a person can achieve physically, intellectually, and spiritually in just one short lifetime. Jesus chose the full experience of a human life, and natural death is a part of that life experience. Though the course of natural events thrust a painful and humiliating death upon him, he met death with courage just as every other person must do when their hour comes. He did not use his human or divine power to escape the situation, not even his powers of persuasion, because others cannot expect a divine intervention in their final moments. The lessons Jesus taught, the matchless life he lived, and his living revelation of the true nature of God were his gifts to the world and for an entire universe.\nIt is important to note that Jesus would have risen to new life on the third day following his death regardless of how he ended his mortal existence. Jesus’ resurrection was a startling and powerful demonstration of the truth he had long taught his followers about the promise of eternal life. The post-resurrection appearances gave Jesus the opportunity to further instruct and extend a personal farewell to each of them; providing them with new strength, courage, devotion, certainty, and resolve to carry on in service, to live by the Father’s will, and to establish the kingdom of heaven even in his absence."

He was in a glorified form, but was made visible to them. He was changed in appearance, but he was recognized and communed with those to whom he appeared. Nearly one thousand human beings witnessed these appearances.\nJesus only appeared to his friends, family, and followers; he did not appear to his enemies, nor to anyone who was not able to spiritually benefit from witnessing his resurrection manifestation."

        "summary": "The Atonement Doctrine – the prevailing belief that Jesus' life was sacrificed to atone for the sins of mankind by order of a vengeful God – is one of the great stumbling blocks to understanding the true nature of a loving God.\nThe atonement doctrine originated in ancient times when the blood of an animal was spilled in order to appease the spirit world. This was driven by primitive men with a great deal of misunderstanding and fear. The spilling of blood, both animal and human, became a part of primitive worship in those long-ago days. In later times, Moses furthered this idea of sacrifice as a ritual for the Hebrews, who regularly slaughtered animals as part of their worship practices; and even further on, Paul expressed this idea as the atonement doctrine, \"the shedding of blood.\"\nAnd so, it can be seen that the concept of atonement is rooted deep in the past when the shedding of blood was thought to be a necessary offering to a deity that was shrouded in mystery and fear."

        "summary": "Messiah, (from Hebrew mashiaḥ, \"anointed\"), in Judaism, is the expected king of the Davidic line who would deliver Israel from foreign bondage and restore the glories of its golden age. The Greek New Testament’s translation of the term, Christos, became the accepted Christian designation and title of Jesus of Nazareth, indicative of the principal character and function of his ministry. More loosely, the term messiah denotes any redeemer figure; and the adjective messianic is used in a broad sense to refer to beliefs or theories about an improvement of the state of humanity or the ultimate destiny of mankind and the world.\nWas Jesus the expected Jewish Messiah? The expectations of the Jewish people for the coming of the Messiah were varied. Some expected a spiritual reawakening, while many hoped for a material ruler who would come in power and cast off the chains of oppression they felt under the Roman yoke. The Jews devoutly believed that, as Moses had delivered their fathers from Egyptian bondage by miraculous wonders, so would the coming Messiah deliver the Jewish people from Roman domination by even greater miracles of power and marvels of racial triumph. They were particularly hoping for a Messiah who would provide them with the long-awaited ideal of \"the land flowing with milk and honey.\"\nThere were differing views as to whether or not the Messiah would be human with supernatural powers or a divine visitation on earth. Little did they expect the combination of human and divine natures incarnated in one man, Jesus. Their rigid dogma caused them to stumble over his divinity, accusing him of blasphemy, and yet they balked at his humble beginnings from Nazareth as the carpenter’s son, asking: \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" Even Jesus’ own parents differed in their opinions of the Messiah."

        "summary": "The mistakes made by Jesus’ early followers were not intentional. They were only misunderstandings of his teachings and the impact of the awe-inspiring events that occurred during and after his extraordinary life. It was natural that these early teachers proclaim the resurrected Jesus, a God-man who died yet lived. And they mistook what he said about his \"second coming,\" thinking he would return during their lifetime.\nThe idea that God demanded Jesus’ life as a ransom for humanity’s alleged sin fit well with the long-established sacrificial beliefs of the times in which he lived. Little did his early followers realize such a concept made God appear to subsequent generations as a heartless and blood-thirsty tyrant. And that belief would become a great stumbling block for many deep-thinking men and women. Many truth-seekers cannot conceive of a good God who would demand that his son submit to such a cruel ordeal to appease his Father’s presumed wrath for humans’ supposed sinfulness.\nBeliefs about the sacrificial and resurrected Jesus displaced the Master’s sublime teachings that God is a loving Father of a universal family of sisters and brothers. The religion about Jesus, which evolved after his death, often overshadows the religion of Jesus – his actual teachings and living example – but in time, his true message will prevail."

When she became pregnant, Joseph was Jesus' biological father, making the birth non-miraculous in biological terms. What made him different is that the Son of God chose this baby in which to incarnate. Through a phenomenon that was a miracle, an entirely human baby also attained the state of being fully divine at the moment of conception. In total, Mary brought nine children into the world and all were born through the normal biological process.\nThroughout history, many people have claimed that their most important leaders were born of virgins; their careers are filled with miraculous events, and their return is always anticipated by their respective followers. While the New Testament's Gospel of Matthew cites a virgin birth for Jesus, other texts like the Gospels of Mark, John, Luke, and the writings of Paul attribute his lineage to Joseph, suggesting a natural birth that aligns with human lineage."

In the next year, he let his mother know that he would not be marrying; his life was so full that he had no time or inclination for marriage.\nSpeculation about a supposed romantic relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene likely arose from a misunderstanding of the facts of her conversion and subsequent role in Jesus’ life."

The profound impact of parental love and guidance on a child's spiritual and emotional well-being ultimately shapes their life trajectory. Creating such homes is a crucial parental responsibility and requires education and training to be truly prepared for the most important task a person can ever undertake – parenting.\nThe home is the basic institution of civilization, and the methods whereby Jesus assisted Mary in raising their family after his father Joseph's death, in addition to other comments he made about the ideal family, give us a wealth of information to consider how we might better maintain a healthy family life and be wise parents in modern times. The love, devotion, and wisdom within a home have a profound influence on religion, and true religion, in turn, enhances the home.

Herod's paranoia led to a massacre of male infants, prompting Joseph and Mary to flee to Egypt with Jesus. After returning home, Jesus grew up in a loving and learning environment. He developed intellectually and spiritually, engaging in deep conversations and questioning various subjects. Jesus assumed increasing responsibilities within his family, especially after the death of his father at age 14, shouldering the financial burden and caring for his widowed mother and eight siblings.\nAs Jesus matured, he balanced his family duties with a growing awareness of his divine mission. He studied different cultures and engaged with people from diverse backgrounds. Throughout his twenties, Jesus embarked on journeys, both within Palestine and beyond, learning, teaching, and deepening his understanding of human nature. He maintained humility, focusing on his spiritual purpose rather than seeking worldly recognition. In his late twenties, he took a Mediterranean tour, conducted a caravan, returned to Nazareth, and volunteered for another journey. These experiences exposed him to various peoples and cultures and refined his understanding of his divine mission.\nAt age 31, Jesus declared that his time had come, and this marked the beginning of his public ministry and the fulfillment of his Father's will. Jesus, along with his brothers James and Jude, was baptized by John the Baptist. As Jesus emerged from the water, a voice proclaimed him as the beloved Son of God. Following his baptism, Jesus secluded himself for forty days. Upon his return, he began assembling his apostles, selecting twelve men to carry on his work after his departure."
