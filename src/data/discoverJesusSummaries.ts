    "shortSummary": "Jesus\u2019 ancestry reflects a blend of spiritual, cultural, and racial influences, with Joseph and Mary chosen to provide the ideal foundation for his divine mission.",
    "fullSummary": "The ancestry of Jesus offers a profound insight into the careful selection of his earthly parents, Joseph and Mary, as well as the evolutionary and cultural factors that shaped their lineage. Jesus\u2019 human heritage was a rich blend of racial, cultural, and spiritual influences, chosen to ensure the Son of God embodied the fullness of humanity while serving as the Son of Man.\nJoseph and Mary were chosen personally by Gabriel from among three final couples that had been selected for their racial diversity, spiritual qualities, and personality strengths. Palestine, being the crossroads of the ancient world, along with the choice of Joseph and Mary as the parents of the \"son of destiny,\" provided Jesus with the best possible home and human foundation for his divine mission. Through Joseph, Jesus inherited gentleness, spiritual understanding, and a keen reverence for tradition; through Mary, he gained optimism, determination, and a broader spiritual outlook. The composite heritage of both parents reflects the evolutionary history of humanity and underscores Jesus\u2019 role as a universal savior \u2013 a Son of God who embraced the fullness of human life while he lived as a revelation of the real nature of God the Father and eternal truth for all humanity and future generations."

    "shortSummary": "Jesus announced that his hour had come to his brothers James and Jude. The three of them traveled to John the Baptist\u2019s camp and were baptized in the Jordan. A celestial voice was heard and Jesus retreated immediately to the hills for forty days.",
    "fullSummary": "John the Baptist engaged in an extensive campaign of preaching and baptizing throughout the year 25 CE. His fame had spread and his message of repentance and baptism was very popular throughout all Palestine. Jesus spoke favorably of John and his message and this inspired the Zebedee brothers \u2013 John and James \u2013 to present themselves to John for baptism. And they kept Jesus apprised of John\u2019s evangelical activities.\nIn January of 26 CE, Jesus\u2019 brothers James and Jude, approached Jesus to discuss whether they should go to John for baptism, too. After a night of meditation and prayer, Jesus announced that his hour had come and told his brothers that the three of them would leave immediately for John\u2019s encampment.\nAt noon on Monday, January 14, 26 CE, Jesus, along with his brothers, was baptized in the Jordan River by John the Baptist. It was a momentous occasion during which the group of four men standing in the water \u2013 Jesus, James, Jude, and John the Baptist \u2013 experienced a celestial voice that said \"This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.\""

    "fullSummary": "After leaving the Last Supper, Judas informed the captain of the temple guards that he was ready to lead them to Jesus. Arriving at the expected location, Jesus had already left with the apostles, causing Judas to fear their retaliation. He went to Gethsemane instead and requested a company of forty armed soldiers from the Jewish rulers. After facing obstacles, they obtained permission from Pilate and, accompanied by over sixty individuals, including armed soldiers and temple guards, Judas set out to arrest Jesus.\nTheir arrival at Gethsemane aroused the apostles, who headed to where Jesus was sitting alone in the moonlight. The apostles approached from one side and Judas and the armed soldiers approached from the other side. Judas stepped out in front, hoping that he could identify Jesus quickly and the arrest could be made with little fuss. But Jesus stepped up and asked the guards who they wanted before Judas could reach him. He immediately identified himself as the one they were looking for.\nJudas could have stopped there and not carried out his betrayal, but he needed to carry out his bargain with the rulers who were going to pay him. So he embraced Jesus and placed a kiss on his face. It was a shocking scene. Jesus once again asked the soldiers who they were looking for, and again he identified himself as the one they wanted. He told them he was ready to go with them."

    "shortSummary": "Joseph and Mary traveled to Bethlehem for a census. Unable to find proper lodging, they stayed in a stable where Jesus was born. Herod ordered the massacre of male babies and they fled to Egypt with Jesus, returning after two years.",
    "fullSummary": "In mid-August, 7 BCE, Joseph prepared to go to Bethlehem to register for a census of Herod\u2019s kingdom for taxation purposes. Mary insisted on accompanying him. They set off from Nazareth, with Mary riding on a donkey while Joseph walked. When they reached Bethlehem, due to a lack of available rooms, they found lodging in a cleaned-up stable below an overcrowded inn. Mary was weary and asked Joseph to stay with her instead of enrolling immediately. The next day, on August 21st, 7 BCE, Mary gave birth to Jesus. A few weeks later, priests from Mesopotamia, guided by a dream, arrived in Bethlehem and left gifts with Mary for the baby. The legend of the star of Bethlehem originated from an astronomical event involving the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, but later generations turned it into a myth surrounding the birth of Jesus.\nMany weeks after Jesus\u2019 birth, Joseph and Mary went to the temple in Jerusalem to present their baby to the priests, redeem him, and perform the purification ceremony. Simeon and Anna, who were close to the priest Zacharias, had all conspired to dramatize the event. Anna had written a stirring poem that Simeon sang proclaiming Jesus a child of promise, surprising Joseph, Mary, and others present. Joseph and Mary were overwhelmed by this public event.\nAfter the visit of the priests of Ur to Bethlehem, Herod became suspicious and summoned them for questioning. Unsatisfied with their explanation, he sent them to find the child and report back. Meanwhile, Herod's informers brought him news of the event in the temple but failed to follow Joseph and Mary. Herod, growing angry, demanded the child be brought to him, but failing to find him after a year of searching, he ruthlessly ordered all male babies in Bethlehem under two years old be killed. Joseph and Mary, warned by a member of Herod\u2019s court and believer in the coming Messiah, fled the night before the massacre occurred to Alexandria in Egypt with Jesus, where they stayed for two years before returning to Bethlehem."

    "fullSummary": "Immediately after Jesus came up out of the water of the Jordan at his baptism, he headed off towards the hills of Perea and was not seen again for forty days. At the time of his baptism, Jesus received a vision of himself as a divine being \u2013 who he was before he came to earth and who he would be at the end of his life here. He embarked on this sojourn of isolation in order to think thoroughly and carefully about how he would assimilate this knowledge in light of his plans for his public work of proclaiming the new kingdom of God in the hearts of men.\nAs Jesus was in the hills of Perea, orienting himself with his surroundings, Gabriel appeared to him and informed him that the requirements of his bestowal mission on earth had been completed to the Universal Father\u2019s satisfaction. Jesus was told that he could terminate his mission at any time and that his path, from this point, was one of his own choosing. But he decided to stay and continue his work of revealing the Father to mortals and show forth his divine character of love.\nDuring the forty days, Jesus did not go without food; he did not suffer from hunger. No evil spirits bothered him, and there was no \"temptation in the wilderness.\" Here in the hills, Jesus\u2019 human and divine minds began to function together, as one. He recalled what Immanuel had said to him and later did as he had ordered, namely, to leave no personal writing on the planet. Gabriel told him he could proceed in his own way or the Father's way. Jesus chose the Father\u2019s way."

    "shortSummary": "Following his return from Mount Hermon, Jesus attends a wedding. Although supernatural expectations were high, Jesus wanted to avoid drawing attention to himself. But he inadvertently turned water into wine in an act of sympathy for his mother.",
    "fullSummary": "The wedding at Cana took place on Wednesday, February 27, 26 CE, soon after Jesus had returned from his forty-day sojourn on Mount Hermon and after he had selected the first six apostles. At the time of the wedding of Naomi, the whole town and surrounding areas had heard the story of Jesus\u2019 baptism in January. On the day of his baptism, a spirit presence appeared over the head of Jesus, and a voice from the heavens announced, \"This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.\" And this heavenly vision was witnessed by James and Jude, Jesus\u2019 brothers, and John the Baptist.\nSo, when Jesus, his family, and his six new apostles went to the wedding, everyone was expecting some kind of supernatural occurrence. But Jesus did not want to draw attention to himself. He counseled Mary, his mother, and his apostles that they were not to expect anything like that to happen, as his hour had not yet come.\nNevertheless, the events of the wedding party caused Mary to approach him for help. The family had run out of wine and were on the verge of embarrassment. Reluctantly, Jesus told his mother that if it was God\u2019s will, he would help. And moments later, the stewards began drawing wine from six large waterpots."

    "shortSummary": "In 29 CE, Jesus empowered a group of women, allowing them to teach the gospel and care for the sick, marking a pivotal moment in religious history. This progressive step was well received but faded in later Christian generations.",
    "fullSummary": "In 29 CE, Jesus made a groundbreaking announcement that astounded both his disciples and the community around him. He declared that he would choose ten devout women to be dedicated to the ministerial work of the kingdom. These women had listened to the teachings given to the young evangelists, but they never imagined that Jesus would commission them to teach the gospel and care for the sick.\nThis proclamation by Jesus was nothing short of an emancipation proclamation, liberating women from spiritual inferiority forever. Men were no longer to view women as lesser beings in the realm of religion and spirituality. While Jesus had previously declared the equality of all as children of God, this formal commissioning of women as religious teachers and allowing them to travel with the group was a radical step.\nThis event had a profound impact on the nation, with both supporters and enemies of Jesus taking notice. The women remained dedicated to their mission, gaining the approval of many, including the apostles who initially embraced this liberation of women's roles. The women's corps grew in strength and expanded their ministry, training an additional fifty women in home visitation and caring for the sick and afflicted."

    "fullSummary": "In March of 29 CE, Jesus was increasingly occupied with teaching. But he was also followed everywhere he went by people who wanted him to heal them or their sick relatives or friends. On March 27, he decided that he desperately needed a break from the crowds. He and the apostles planned to row across the lake unnoticed. But the multitudes did notice, and thousands followed him on that day and the following three days. By Wednesday, March 30, more than five thousand people had gathered in this large park.\nBy the third day, food began to be an issue, as most people had not brought enough. Even the provisions that Jesus and the apostles had brought along were dwindling by this time. Rumors were going around that Jesus was going to use this spot to declare himself the king of the Jews, and the crowd was in a state of anticipation.\nOn Wednesday, Jesus asked that the apostolic food be brought to him and, after organizing the large multitude in groups, he began to hand out food to the apostles who carried it to the evangelists and then into the crowd. By the end of the day, five thousand people had been miraculously fed from the apostolic stores of five barley loaves and two fishes. There were twelve baskets of food left over after everyone was fed, which were collected by the disciples."

He led them to the highlands north of Capernaum, where he proceeded to instruct them in preparation for their formal ordination. Following these preliminary remarks regarding the kingdom of heaven, the Master formally ordained each apostle, starting with Judas Iscariot and ending with Andrew.\nAfter he had completed the ordination, the apostles rose and embraced Jesus one by one, as a host of celestial personalities witnessed this extraordinary scene of the Creator of the universe placing the affairs of the kingdom of heaven under the direction of this group of twelve ordinary men.\nAnd then Jesus delivered his ordination sermon to these twelve apostles, charging them with instructions regarding the conduct and attitudes that would mark their activities for the kingdom of heaven from this day forward."

    "fullSummary": "On June 9, 29 CE, in response to a question posed by the Apostle Thomas, Jesus delivered an important discourse on religion to the apostles and the twelve evangelists. Thomas asked: \"Master, I would really like to know just what is wrong with the religion of our enemies at Jerusalem. What is the real difference between their religion and ours? Why is it we are at such diversity of belief when we all profess to serve the same God?\"\nIn this memorable discourse on religion, Jesus revealed essential truths regarding the expression of religious devotion. He explained that while the world's religions have two origins, natural and revelatory, at any given time and among any given people, there are three distinct forms of religious devotion. The three manifestations of the religious urge are:\nAlthough the Master did not intend to undermine the religion of the physical senses and the superstitious fears of people, he expressed his dismay at the enduring presence of this primitive form of worship in the religious practices of the more intelligent human races."

Jesus lodged with Simon, a leading citizen of that city, and prepared himself for the days ahead.\nJesus made his triumphal entrance into Jerusalem on Sunday, April 2, 30 CE after careful thought as to how he would proceed into the city. He chose to honor a prophetic scripture found in Zechariah that spoke of a \"lowly one, riding on a donkey.\" This approach, Jesus felt, was the appropriate way to impress on all that he was not a warrior king; his kingdom was a purely spiritual reality.\nA large festive procession formed around Jesus as they left Bethany. The mood was merry and carefree, until the Master paused at Olivet to weep over the city below him, lamenting the fact that the Jews were about to reject him and his mission."

    "fullSummary": "When Jesus said his final goodbyes at the Last Supper, he had particular words of comfort and advice for each apostle. When the Master spoke to Simon Peter, he warned him about his unthinking outbursts. He told him that this would be a source of much trouble for him and that it might take a difficult lesson for him to learn how to control himself. Despite Peter\u2019s declarations of love and loyalty, Jesus finally told Peter that this very night he would have such a difficult lesson when he would betray his Master three or four times before the cock crowed.\nLater that night, Peter managed to enter the courtyard of Annas\u2019 palace, ignoring Jesus\u2019 advice not to go off alone. And while there, he denied the Master four times to the portress and other servants who happened to be there. They repeatedly asked him if he was one of the Master\u2019s followers and he repeatedly denied that he was, even vehemently. After his last denial of being associated with Jesus, the cock crowed, reminding Peter of the words of the Master\u2019s warning earlier that night.

He assured them that all was well, and went to Lazarus' tomb, where Jesus prayed and commanded Lazarus to come forth. Lazarus came back to life, still wrapped in his grave cloths.

This meeting took place during October of 27 CE, on the slopes of Mount Gilboa where Jesus and his apostles were camped.Jesus was present for the first week of this three-week conference but left them alone for the last two weeks. He did this because he wanted these men to learn how to harmonize their differences without his help. While he was away, the two groups of apostles debated and decided on several issues and practices. Among their first decisions were which form of prayer to adopt and whether to baptize believers. They also agreed on what to do until John was either released or executed.\nMany other matters were resolved during this meeting and Jesus pledged to support the spirit of their choices. And they planned to meet again for one week every three months. This conference between the apostles of Jesus and the apostles of John the Baptist was a significant event in the early days of Jesus' ministry. It was a crucial step in preparing the apostles and believers for their future work of establishing the religion of and about Jesus."

    "fullSummary": "Following the last supper with his apostles, Jesus prayed alone to his Father, wondering if it was really his will to see his beloved son mercilessly put to death. A feeling of abandonment, failure, things not working out as intended, helplessness in not having everything succeed the way he intended, and a sorrowful heart weighing him down. At the point at which many humans despair and lose their will to live, the human Jesus faced squarely and climbed out, epitomizing all the lovely traits of a human person: love, bravery, courage, faith, and commitment to do the will of God. He faced human anxiety, sadness, and loneliness and triumphed revealing all the best a human being can be."

    "fullSummary": "Understanding Jesus' expectations of this long-awaited pilgrimage to Jerusalem helps you gain a better insight into Jesus' reactions to the entire experience. On one hand, everything he had ever imagined Jerusalem and the temple to be in regards to the awe and beauty of the material grounds, buildings, and the city of Jerusalem did not disappoint. There were also some unexpected thrills during his visit, but much of the behavior of the people during his experience at the temple disappointed him to the very core of his being. The visit of a celestial being during this journey ended up serving as a reminder and challenge to him \u2013 a confirmation of his purpose and consecration of his will to seek to do the heavenly Father\u2019s will.\nLiving in Nazareth, with the liberal interpretation of the rabbis, allowed him to interact with gentiles and had prepared Jesus somewhat for what he was about to encounter; but Jesus had been sheltered from the corrupt, commercial aspect of the temple proceedings in Jerusalem. This young, sensitive soul was about to encounter one of the great shocks of his life, and the opportunity to experience a better understanding of the world as it existed in first-century Palestine.\nDuring the Passover week, Jesus kept his place and listened attentively to the discussions. Upon its conclusion, Joseph and Mary mistakenly left Jesus behind. He remained at the temple, engaging scholars with his wisdom. When they found him days later, he calmly explained his purpose and pledged to be obedient to both his heavenly and earthly fathers. Jesus' time at the temple allowed him to shine and left a lasting impression on those who heard him speak."

It was held in late September or early October, at the end of the harvest season, and was attended by many thousands who journeyed to Jerusalem from points near and far.\nJesus attended the feast of 29 CE, the last full year of his life. He had been to other Sukkot, but this one was different because he was not a participant; rather, he was a teacher. At Jerusalem\u2019s temple, he openly declared his mission to establish God\u2019s spiritual kingdom on earth, sharing discourses on the light of the world, the water of life, and spiritual freedom. He also exposed the evil of his tradition-bound enemies who desperately wanted to arrest and kill him.

    "fullSummary": "When Jesus was 31 years old, in 25 CE, he completed his final tour through the heart of Palestine as a private citizen. At the end of this tour, Jesus was led by his indwelling spirit to Mount Hermon, where he spent six weeks alone with God. The purpose of this journey was for Jesus to complete the mastery of his human mind and fully consecrate himself to the remainder of his lifework on earth.\nIt was an unusual time in Jesus\u2019 life and was similar to the subsequent period of forty days that he spent on Mount Hermon just after his baptism (in January of 26 CE) that inaugurated the divine phase of Jesus' earthly career. That period has become associated with the so-called \"great temptation\" of Jesus, but in fact, those events happened on Mount Hermon in the preceding year.\nNear the end of this sojourn, Jesus asked his heavenly Father if he could have a conference with the rebels who had instigated the planetary rebellion. He wanted to confront them as himself, the human Jesus. His request was granted, and these rebels were made visible to him. This meeting between Jesus, Caligastia (our rebellious Planetary Prince), and Satan (Lucifer\u2019s representative) took place in the last week of Jesus\u2019 sojourn.

    "fullSummary": "One of Jesus\u2019 most well-known miracles was feeding five thousand followers gathered in a park in March of 29 CE. These people had been camped around the Master for three days, and most had nothing left to eat. Jesus was moved to feed them, and when they had finished eating, they wanted to enthrone him and make him their king.\nIt was a huge disappointment to his apostles and admirers when Jesus refused. His mission was to create a spiritual kingdom, not a political one. A great many followers abandoned him after the refusal. The apostles did not leave him, but it was a hard lesson for them and his remaining disciples to realize that miracles seldom bring people closer to God, only expectations of more miracles."

These twelve men represented many different types of human temperament, and they had not been made alike by schooling.\nAs a group, they were neither completely ignorant nor unlearned. All of them, with the exception of the Alpheus twins, were graduates of the synagogue schools and were well-versed in the Hebrew scriptures and much of the contemporary knowledge of the time. There were no better Jewish schools in all of Galilee than the Capernaum synagogue schools, from which seven of the disciples had graduated.\nThe fact that only one of Jesus' apostles deserted him, even though he repeatedly dashed their hopes and destroyed their aspirations for personal exaltation, is an elegant testament to the charm and righteousness of his earthly life."

    "fullSummary": "Today, as in Jesus' time, a gentile is known as a non-Jewish person. The Jews of Jesus\u2019 time would have considered Roman citizens, Roman military, Greeks, Syrians, and slaves as gentiles. The Jews lived among the gentiles, but it is estimated that they comprised only about 10-20% of the population of the Roman Empire. Within their ranks, the gentile was an outsider. The gentiles in power of the Roman Empire were thought of as oppressors and persecutors.\nSome of the more high-minded or religious among the gentiles were tolerated by the Jews. They permitted some of the more \"devout\" or \"God-fearing\" men among them entry and access to the temples, but they were generally not viewed favorably by the Jews. Even so, there was a court of the gentiles in the Jerusalem temple, and Paul's first converts to Christianity came from this fringe group.\nGentile philosophy appealed more to the elite, and the gentile religions appealed more to the average person.

    "fullSummary": "Pharisees were religious scholars and guardians of Jewish oral law from around 500 to 70 CE. Their origin can be traced back to Moses who, according to Pharisees, established both oral and written Jewish law. In some ways, they were the progressive group among the priestly class, having adopted many teachings that were not in the Hebrew scriptures, such as belief in the resurrection of the dead.\nThe Pharisees were known for their strict adherence to oral laws and traditions, as opposed to the written law that the Sadducees proclaimed. The Pharisees resisted Jesus' teachings soon after he became well-known. They saw him as a threat to their authority and influence. They were not open to new ideas or interpretations of oral law, and they persisted in attempts to discredit Jesus and undermine his message. Jesus criticized their faulty teaching and replaced it with a message of love, compassion, and spiritual growth.\nNot all Pharisees were opposed to Jesus. Some well-known Pharisees, such as Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, were open to his teachings and became his followers. As a group, however, the Pharisees represented a rigid, cold, and legalistic approach to religion. When their meaningless practices and misleading teachings were contradicted by Jesus, the Pharisees questioned and threatened him for flouting Jewish tradition. Because some within their ranks became Jesus\u2019 followers, deep internal divisions developed. Those divides were a source of confusion regarding what to do with Jesus. Tradition won in the short term, and Jesus was put to death. In the long term, his teachings took over the Western world and the Pharisees died out."

    "fullSummary": "Around the time of Christ, the Sadducees were the high priests of the Jewish people. They were wealthy and aristocratic men and members of the Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish council of religious regulators, enforcers, and judges. The Sadducees\u2019 responsibilities included presiding over the animal sacrifices at the Jerusalem temple. Sacrificial rites, administered by priests, were the primary method of worship in ancient Israel.\nSadducees held their positions as priest-judges for about 220 years, from the mid-2nd century BCE until 70 CE. Then, the Roman army demolished the temple while putting down a Jewish rebellion. The Sadducees faded into obscurity after that as a new form of Judaism emerged from Jerusalem\u2019s ashes.\nDuring Jesus\u2019 public life, from 26 to 30 CE, the Sadducees became his enemies because his teachings did not follow certain aspects of Jewish tradition, such as blood sacrifice and the need for priests. After the Master began his public ministry, the Sadducees sent spies and harassers to follow and entrap him as a lawbreaker. He became very popular among the common people, and that helped him evade capture for over three years."

The Jews held a deep-seated hatred of them, although they believed many of the same teachings.\nThe Samaritans originated around 700 BCE. This group originally numbered twenty-five thousand Jews who had been placed into captivity in Samaria by King Sargon of Assyria when he ended a revolt in Palestine. In their place, he put descendents of other sects. Later, he sent other colonies to live in Samaria.\nAt the end of the Babylonian captivity of the Jews, these Samaritans opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalem. Moreover, they became friendly with Alexander the Great and his armies. Alexander permitted the Samaritans to build a temple on Mount Gerizim.

They constituted a court system for trying and prosecuting those accused of religious crimes. It was the Jerusalem Sanhedrin who closed all of the synagogues to Jesus and was later responsible for passing the decree of death on Jesus.\nNot all of the Sanhedrin were hostile to Jesus. Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea, both wealthy members of the Jewish Sanhedrin, became exceptional supporters of Jesus, diverging from the council's antagonistic stance by providing safe havens and managing Jesus' burial.

These spies attempted to challenge Jesus on practices like Sabbath observance and traditional fastings, but Jesus countered their accusations with wisdom that highlighted the spirit of the law over literal interpretations. His responses emphasized the importance of compassion and mercy, such as healing on the Sabbath and critiquing the Pharisees' adherence to man-made traditions over God's commandments.\nUltimately, the mission of the spies led to a split among them; while some returned to Jerusalem still conflicted, three were profoundly influenced by Jesus' teachings, choosing to convert and accept baptism, demonstrating the transformative impact of Jesus' message on even those initially sent to undermine him."

    "fullSummary": "Jesus, born as Joshua ben Joseph, lived a remarkable life filled with diverse experiences and significant milestones. His childhood was not without challenges. Herod's paranoia led to a massacre of male infants, prompting Joseph and Mary to flee to Egypt with Jesus. After returning home, Jesus grew up in a loving and learning environment. He developed intellectually and spiritually, engaging in deep conversations and questioning various subjects. Jesus assumed increasing responsibilities within his family, especially after the death of his father at age 14, shouldering the financial burden and caring for his widowed mother and eight siblings.\nAs Jesus matured, he balanced his family duties with a growing awareness of his divine mission. He studied different cultures and engaged with people from diverse backgrounds. Throughout his twenties, Jesus embarked on journeys, both within Palestine and beyond, learning, teaching, and deepening his understanding of human nature. He maintained humility, focusing on his spiritual purpose rather than seeking worldly recognition. In his late twenties, he took a Mediterranean tour, conducted a caravan, returned to Nazareth, and volunteered for another journey. These experiences exposed him to various peoples and cultures and refined his understanding of his divine mission.\nAt age 31, Jesus declared that his time had come, and this marked the beginning of his public ministry and the fulfillment of his Father's will. Jesus, along with his brothers James and Jude, was baptized by John the Baptist. As Jesus emerged from the water, a voice proclaimed him as the beloved Son of God.

    "fullSummary": "Andrew was the first of six apostles chosen by Jesus on February 23, 26 CE. That same day his brother, Simon Peter, was selected as the second. Andrew was in Jesus\u2019 inner circle along with Simon Peter, and two others, John and James Zebedee, for more than four years. Philip and Nathaniel were the fifth and sixth apostles to be chosen by Jesus. When Jesus asked each of these original six apostles to select another, Andrew chose Matthew Levi, after whom the Gospel of Matthew is named.\nAfter all twelve apostles had been chosen, Jesus appointed Andrew, the oldest, as their director. Working together with Abner\u2014director of John the Baptist\u2019s disciples\u2014Andrew played an important role in harmonizing the two groups. Very often it was Andrew who decided which pair of apostles would go on preaching tours and where they should go. He was also responsible for authorizing the distribution of the group\u2019s funds. Andrew was a good administrator and calming influence on the other apostles, especially his emotional brother Peter. And he was the only apostle who suspected that Judas Iscariot was going to betray Jesus.\nAfter Jesus died, Andrew traveled widely and brought many thousands into the kingdom. When Christian persecutions finally caught up to Andrew, he was in Patras, Greece where he was hung on a cross and continued to proclaim the gospel message until his death two days later. Andrew was martyred sometime between 60-70 CE."

    "fullSummary": "Josef Ben Caiaphas, 14 BCE \u2013 46 CE, was the Sanhedrin\u2019s high priest during Jesus\u2019 lifetime. Caiaphas is best known for presiding over the mock trial of Jesus. He was a son-in-law of Annas, a former high priest of Jerusalem. They both sat in judgment of Jesus at Caiaphas\u2019 home, and Caiaphas slapped Jesus when he affirmatively answered the question: \"Are you the Son of God?\"The apostle Judas conspired with Caiaphas to capture Jesus. After Jesus\u2019 arrest, Judas was paid and dismissed with utter contempt from Caiaphas and the other members of the Sanhedrin court. Caiaphas then led the court in condemning Jesus to death. When Roman governor Pilate hesitated to confirm the Sanhedrin\u2019s ruling, Caiaphas threatened to tell the Roman emperor that Pilate failed in his duty to execute a rebel. Pilate yielded, and Jesus was crucified. Six years later, both Caiaphas and Pilate were removed from office."

Father Zebedee was friends with Jesus\u2019 father Joseph, and that explains how the Zebedees and Jesus became acquainted. Before Jesus began his public ministry, he and all the Zebedees became close friends during a one-year period in which Jesus lived with the family and worked in their boat shop. In that year, Jesus often went fishing with David, James, and John. David was deeply impressed by Jesus, not by his religious views or philosophic teachings, but because he saw Jesus as a great man.\nIn January of 28 CE, David decided to volunteer as one of Jesus\u2019 helpers. This was almost two years after his brothers, John and James, were accepted as Jesus\u2019 apostles. David was not interested in serving as an apostle, but he chose to assist in other ways. It occurred to him there was a need for a messenger service to keep Jesus and his followers informed about current events, to warn them of impending dangers, and to maintain contact with their families. David undertook this much-needed service on his own initiative, no one asked him to create a \"messenger corps.\" At one time, fifty runners were employed in this service.\nDavid is best described as a man of courage, action, and insight; a determined, dependable, and thoughtful worker who sees a need and fills it. Besides the messenger service, he also provided shelter for Jesus and his followers when needed, such as tents for rest and protection from the elements. He took on yet another job when the apostles\u2019 savings were depleted. They went fishing and would sell their catch to David, who then sold it to buyers. He also had his couriers collect funds as they traveled about delivering messages to believers. David supported himself by fishing."

    "fullSummary": "In April 22 CE, Jesus, Gonod, and Ganid traveled from Jerusalem to Joppa, the first stop in their nearly two-year tour of the Mediterranean regions. While in Joppa, Jesus met Gadiah, a young Philistine interpreter who worked for a leather merchant. Jesus and Gadiah struck up a friendship based on truth-seeking on Gadiah\u2019s part and truth-giving on Jesus\u2019 part.\nJesus and Gadiah had two memorable discussions. One discussion concerned the Bible story of Jonah being swallowed by the whale. Gadiah wanted to know if Jesus believed the story. Jesus responded in such a way as to honor Gadiah\u2019s beliefs and the positive impact that the story had had on him. He told him that all human beings can identify with Jonah\u2019s story and the way he was delivered by God from his selfishness. Jesus\u2019 words touched Gadiah\u2019s heart, and the two men continued talking into the night.\nAnother discussion concerned Gadiah\u2019s inner turmoil over the issue of good and evil and why God permits the suffering that evil brings; he asked Jesus, \"Who creates evil?\" And Jesus, knowing that many people of that day believed that God created both good and evil, went on to reveal the goodness of God that is so encompassing that it cannot contain evil, much less create it. Humans, endowed with free will, can choose evil as a potential alternative to goodness. If chosen enough times, evil can become sin. And like the parable of the wheat and weeds, good and evil coexist until the harvest."

Her primary work was with the other members of the evangelistic women\u2019s corps, laboring with, and for, other women.\nMary was present at the crucifixion, and it was to her that Jesus first appeared following his resurrection.

    "fullSummary": "Matthew Levi was the seventh apostle. Because he was an experienced money gatherer, he was appointed the apostles\u2019 finance officer. He faithfully held this office for four years, never failing to supply adequate funding for the group. Matthew was always loyal to Jesus and his mission, but because of his responsibility as the \"money getter,\" he missed some of Jesus\u2019 most valuable teachings and remarkable acts.\nMatthew was the wealthiest of the apostles when he joined the group and became their fundraiser. He often drew on his personal savings to keep the treasury supplied, though he told no one about it. It meant a great deal to Matthew that he, a \"publican,\" was invited to be one of the apostles. Prejudice against tax collectors was not uncommon, and it required time for him to be accepted by some of the other apostles. But he proved himself a worthy and loyal friend to all and a devoted champion of Jesus\u2019 mission. And he became a role model for well-to-do people of his time, and others who are custodians of wealth in times since. After Jesus\u2019 crucifixion, when persecution drove him and the other believers out of Jerusalem, Matthew went north and west to Syria and beyond, spreading the gospel until he himself was martyred in Thrace, Greece. He was practically penniless when he died, having contributed his wealth to the mission to which he gave his full devotion, even his mortal life."

    "fullSummary": "Once known as Saul of Tarsus, Paul had a powerful conversion experience after the death of Stephen, the first martyr of Christianity. Fourteen of the 27 books in the New Testament of the Bible have traditionally been attributed to Paul. He founded several Christian communities in Asia Minor and Europe in the 40s and 50s CE.\nPaul's Christian church deviated from Jesus' original intention of the kingdom of heaven. The focus shifted from individual spiritual experience to the collective body of believers, and Jesus became the head of the church rather than the elder brother of each believer. This departure undermined Jesus' concept of the divine kingdom within the individual's heart.\nEarly Christian doctrines were influenced by Philo of Alexandria, Jesus, and Paul. Paul introduced the concept of atonement for sin through blood sacrifice and burdened Christianity unnecessarily. However, Paul did put an end to the doctrines of redemption through human or animal sacrifices by proclaiming Christ as the last and all-sufficient sacrifice, satisfying the divine Judge."

Despite this momentary lapse in understanding, she was a dedicated helper and assistant to Jesus and his ministry for four years.

When Jesus asked each of the first six apostles to choose another, Simon Peter, the second apostle, selected Simon Zelotes. Simon was a merchant in Capernaum at one time, but then he turned his attention to a patriotic organization, the Zealots. The Zealots advocated expelling the Roman government from Palestine by rebellion, and Simon held a high office in that organization.\nBefore joining the apostles, Simon held tightly to the traditional belief that a Messiah would come to power and liberate the Jewish people from their Roman oppressors. After becoming an apostle, he came to believe that Jesus was that Messiah, despite Jesus\u2019 repeated statements to the contrary. He was a stubborn and fiery agitator and often spoke without thinking. But during his nearly four years\u2019 working for and with Jesus, Simon, for the most part, performed admirably. And his loyalty to Jesus did not waver, even after the Master died.\nSimon\u2019s great weakness was his material-mindedness; his strength was his inspirational loyalty. Both were severely tested during his service as Jesus\u2019 apostle. He deeply admired Jesus and remained a devoted follower throughout all the trials and rigors of this service. After Jesus\u2019 death, Simon became depressed for some time but later recovered and went deep into Africa carrying the gospel message.

When he was thirteen he had an important role to play in the serious political crisis that affected Jesus so deeply.

Judas was nominated by Nathaniel, one of the first six apostles.\nWhen Nathaniel met Judas at Tarichea, Judas was thirty years of age and unmarried. He was probably the best-educated man among the twelve and the only Judean in the Master's apostolic family. The Judeans looked down upon Galileans as being less sophisticated and not as religious as they were. Judas was never able to rise above his Judean prejudices against his Galilean associates. And Jesus himself was a Galilean.\nAlmost from the beginning, Judas began finding fault with Jesus, questioning him about why nothing was being done to get John the Baptist out of prison. Judas was also preoccupied with what position he was to hold in the coming kingdom. As it was, his position in the apostolic party was as treasurer; he carried the money, kept the budget, and handed out funds as needed. Up to the time of the betrayal of his Master, he discharged the responsibilities of his office honestly, faithfully, and most efficiently. He was good with money.

    "fullSummary": "Apparent accidents are a part of life in a vulnerable body in an environment that is always presenting new, often unrecognized, and sometimes dangerous situations. God created this world and is unlimited in its management. But, like a wise parent, God only intervenes in the lives of his children when divine wisdom indicates an adjustment is needed for the highest good of all concerned.\nEarly humans, lacking scientific knowledge, blamed invisible forces for accidents and misfortunes, leading to rituals and sacrifices aimed at appeasing these entities. Today, scientific reasoning prevails where superstition once reigned. While accidents are inevitable in a world governed by free will and natural law, they can also lead to personal growth and societal progress.\nGod could prevent accidents, but doing so would undermine human free will and the opportunity for growth through experience. Recognizing accidents within a universe governed by law and order, where effects follow causes and divine intervention is selective, helps reconcile faith with the inevitability of life's unpredictable events."

Studying his life, understanding his decisions, modeling our religious practices, serving with sincere love for our fellows, and sharing our life with God through prayer and worship is only a beginning when attempting to achieve the acme of religious living and striving to become perfect in the eyes of God. It was said that Jesus was the perfectly unified human personality. Today, through his Spirit of Truth, he continues to unify life, ennoble character, and transform and transfigure the person. Jesus reveals that we are also children of the Universal Father, and we may presume upon him to develop a loving and eternal personal relationship with God.

    "fullSummary": "Anger is like poison to the spirit. It is a harmful emotion that can cause great damage to ourselves and others. When we become angry, it is like throwing a stone into a hornet's nest \u2013 it stirs up trouble and creates chaos. Anxiety and fear were common among our early ancestors. These feelings helped them survive and adapt to their environment. However, excessive anxiety can be harmful, leading to anger and inhibiting our progress. It is important to find a balance and not let anger control us or cause harm to others.\nAnger is a sign of our spiritual nature losing control over our thoughts and actions. It shows a lack of love, self-respect, and self-control. Anger can harm our health, cloud our minds, and hinder our spiritual growth. Remembering the teachings of love and patience can help us overcome anger and find peace within ourselves. Our ancestors were quite aggressive and prone to war in the early days of humanity. Later, humanity was taught the golden rule \u2013 to treat others as they would like to be treated. When they lived by this code, they were able to avoid violent conflicts and valued peace and harmony. More recently, Jesus entreated us to love one another as he loved us, which is the highest love and tolerance the world has ever known.\nLet your heart be so dominated by love that your spirit guide will have little trouble in delivering you from the tendency to give vent to those outbursts of animal anger that are inconsistent with the status of divine sonship.

    "fullSummary": "Messiah, (from Hebrew mashia\u1e25, \"anointed\"), in Judaism, is the expected king of the Davidic line who would deliver Israel from foreign bondage and restore the glories of its golden age. The Greek New Testament\u2019s translation of the term, Christos, became the accepted Christian designation and title of Jesus of Nazareth, indicative of the principal character and function of his ministry. More loosely, the term messiah denotes any redeemer figure; and the adjective messianic is used in a broad sense to refer to beliefs or theories about an improvement of the state of humanity or the ultimate destiny of mankind and the world.\nWas Jesus the expected Jewish Messiah? The expectations of the Jewish people for the coming of the Messiah were varied. Some expected a spiritual reawakening, while many hoped for a material ruler who would come in power and cast off the chains of oppression they felt under the Roman yoke. The Jews devoutly believed that, as Moses had delivered their fathers from Egyptian bondage by miraculous wonders, so would the coming Messiah deliver the Jewish people from Roman domination by even greater miracles of power and marvels of racial triumph. They were particularly hoping for a Messiah who would provide them with the long-awaited ideal of \"the land flowing with milk and honey.\"\nThere were differing views as to whether or not the Messiah would be human with supernatural powers or a divine visitation on earth. Little did they expect the combination of human and divine natures incarnated in one man, Jesus. Their rigid dogma caused them to stumble over his divinity, accusing him of blasphemy, and yet they balked at his humble beginnings from Nazareth as the carpenter\u2019s son, asking: \"Can anything good come out of Nazareth?\" Even Jesus\u2019 own parents differed in their opinions of the Messiah."

And he was faithful to this instruction.\nWhen Jesus was nineteen years old, he received a marriage proposal from Rebecca, a young woman who had fallen in love with him. As he gently let her down, he invoked another reason that he couldn\u2019t be tied to a romantic relationship. In the next year, he let his mother know that he would not be marrying; his life was so full that he had no time or inclination for marriage.\nSpeculation about a supposed romantic relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene likely arose from a misunderstanding of the facts of her conversion and subsequent role in Jesus\u2019 life."

    "shortSummary": "God's inherent kindness, compassion, and mercy flow continually to his creations. It is never necessary to exert any influence on God in order to invoke his loving-kindness.",
    "fullSummary": "God is inherently kind, compassionate, and merciful, with an unwavering love that requires no external influence to be invoked. The mere needs of his creations ensure the continuous outpouring of his tender mercies and saving grace. God's omniscience makes forgiveness easy, as he fully understands his children. Similarly, understanding and love among humans facilitate forgiveness, creating a pathway to genuine compassion.\nJesus draws people toward goodness and righteous living. His profound love sparks a reciprocal response in human hearts, demonstrating that love is contagious and eternally creative. His teachings elevate righteousness above mere technicalities of right and wrong. Unlike mercy, which sets aside guilt, love eradicates sin and its resulting weaknesses. Jesus introduces a transformative way of living, encouraging goodness that effectively overcomes evil without resistance. His forgiveness goes beyond condonation; it signifies salvation from condemnation, correcting wrongs, and ensuring eternal rehabilitation through divine love.\nThrough his personal love, Jesus liberates individuals and empowers them to choose better paths. His portrayal of deliverance from the past promises a triumphant future. Forgiveness becomes the gateway to salvation, as the beauty of divine love, once embraced, forever dispels the allure of sin and weakens the power of evil."

    "shortSummary": "The belief that Jesus' sacrifice appeased a vengeful God for human sins hinders understanding a loving God. Originating from ancient rituals and animal sacrifices, it contrasts with Jesus' revelation of a loving father-God.",
    "fullSummary": "The Atonement Doctrine \u2013 the prevailing belief that Jesus' life was sacrificed to atone for the sins of mankind by order of a vengeful God \u2013 is one of the great stumbling blocks to understanding the true nature of a loving God.\nThe atonement doctrine originated in ancient times when the blood of an animal was spilled in order to appease the spirit world. This was driven by primitive men with a great deal of misunderstanding and fear. The spilling of blood, both animal and human, became a part of primitive worship in those long-ago days. In later times, Moses furthered this idea of sacrifice as a ritual for the Hebrews, who regularly slaughtered animals as part of their worship practices; and even further on, Paul expressed this idea as the atonement doctrine, \"the shedding of blood.\"\nAnd so, it can be seen that the concept of atonement is rooted deep in the past when the shedding of blood was thought to be a necessary offering to a deity that was shrouded in mystery and fear."

    "fullSummary": "Faith and righteousness are connected because our faith and acceptance of the Father\u2019s forgiveness can inspire us to forgive others and to live in a righteous way.\nJesus emphasized the importance of true righteousness \u2013 a righteousness that is sincere and not showy, as was often on display by the Pharisees and others. True righteousness is different from \"self-righteousness.\" Self-righteousness is synonymous with a holier-than-thou attitude that is showy and insincere. True righteousness is not pursued for personal recognition; it is pursued because it is the right thing to do.\nJesus outlined four steps to righteousness that must be taken by all children of God in order to grow into hardy and robust children of God. These steps inspire us to fellowship with our brothers and sisters in acts of loving service. These steps begin with the Father\u2019s forgiveness and proceed naturally to loving and forgiving one another. This is the righteousness that is characterized by goodness, virtue, decency, integrity, and morality in our relations with others."

    "fullSummary": "Through his life and teachings, Jesus taught the practice of fatherly love. Brotherly love is easily seen when we love our neighbor as we love ourselves, and Jesus exhibited this kind of love as the Son of Man. But fatherly love goes one step further. We are called to love one another as Jesus loves us. The Master exhibited fatherly love as the Son of God, our Creator.\nWe can learn to develop fatherly love by seeing our fellow mortals as a loving parent might see them; as God the Father sees them. We can easily start with the golden rule and work our way up. Brotherly love can open the door to fatherly affection.\nJesus used the beatitudes, part of the Ordination Sermon, to exemplify his teachings on brotherly love and fatherly love."

The ability to make important decisions and act courageously in critical moments is secured through a gradual process of repeatedly choosing between good and evil in everyday situations. Moral evaluation with spiritual insight involves making choices between good and evil, right and wrong, and truth and error.

    "fullSummary": "The concept of God has evolved over many centuries and was documented even in Jesus\u2019 time in the Old Testament scripture that recounted the progress of the Jewish people. Jesus outlined this progress of the God concept for the apostles when they wanted to know more about the Father in heaven. And we can benefit from this lesson, too.\nJesus told the apostles about the different stages of the God concept in the Scriptures: from Yahweh, the Most High, El Shaddai, Elohim, the Supreme Yahweh, to the Father in heaven, the concept that he favored in his teachings.\nHe told them that, if they read the Scriptures, they could see this ever-enlarging evolution of mankind\u2019s understanding of God in several of the successive writings of the prophets, and in the evolution of the commandments both before the Israelites\u2019 liberation by Moses and after. He went on to explain that further enlightenment was seen in the later writing in the times of Isaiah, when the negative, \"thou shalt nots\" were transformed into the positive directive to love \u2013 love God and love your neighbor.

    "fullSummary": "Early human worship centered on natural elements, including water. The roots of baptism extend from Babylon and Greek traditions. John the Baptist adapted baptism as a symbol of spiritual cleansing, later modified by Jesus. Baptism's significance evolved from community inclusion to spiritual rebirth. Jesus\u2019 baptism symbolized consecration and to mark the beginning of his public ministry.\nPrior to John the Baptist\u2019s imprisonment, none of Jesus' apostles baptized. However, the majority of Jesus' followers had followed John and been baptized before his first year of ministry. Jesus' apostles ultimately adopted baptism as a price for John's followers joining forces. Jesus supported whatever decision these two groups made. Jesus never objected to the apostles performing John's baptism because he expected a church to follow the true spiritual kingdom. He and the apostles taught that faith admits the truth-loving soul to the spiritual kingdom, and at the same time, the apostles taught that such a believer is admitted to the social organization of disciples through the outward rite of baptism."

    "fullSummary": "Jesus had a revolutionary perspective on women, challenging social norms of the time. He allowed women to be trained in the teachings of the kingdom and minister to the sick. Jesus respected and empowered women, recognizing their worth and equal partnership. He defended women in various situations, advocated for their rights, and showed compassion to those in difficult circumstances. Jesus established a women's corps and had unwavering support from women who followed him. He exemplified high ideals and treated all people, including women, with love, fairness, and respect.\nJesus' first declaration of his divinity was to Nalda, the Samaritan woman at the well. He was not a person who would prefer men over women. He defended women who were being taken advantage of. Unfairness to women aroused his indignation. Jesus was fully supportive of women serving the new revelation of the gospel of the kingdom and working publicly alongside the men at a time in history when it was almost impossible to do. Jesus helped educate his sisters when girls were not allowed to go to school. Jesus' own mother was a well-educated woman for her time and Jesus saw the discrimination of women as being wrong.

    "fullSummary": "The Indwelling Spirit of God, a divine presence that resides within every human mind, is a spirit gift from the Universal Father and constantly strives to lead human beings to God and to help them personally know God. The Spirit sets spiritual standards that are the basis for personality survival, and those who submit to its guidance are led towards God. The kingdom of God is within every person through this spirit presence, and religious faith enables individuals to bridge the gap between intellectual logic and spiritual affirmations of the soul. The spirit indwelling within the human mind reveals the Father-source of all that is true, beautiful, and good. Three separate pieces of evidence of the Spirit's indwelling in the human mind are humanitarian fellowship (love), interpretation of the universe (wisdom), and spiritual evaluation of life (worship).\nThe Indwelling Spirit can be understood as a kind of inner voice or intuition that guides us towards spiritual truths. Following the guidance of the Indwelling Spirit is seen as essential for living a meaningful and fulfilling life. Although the Universal Father lives at the center of all things in the universe, God is not distant or inaccessible, but rather present within us and he can be communicated with through prayer, meditation, and worship. The Spirit provides a rich and complex vision of the nature of God and is a fragment of the infinite consciousness of the Universal Father that lives within each of us."

    "fullSummary": "The common Christian belief that Jesus\u2019 death is fundamentally linked to the Jewish Passover has prevailed for over two thousand years. Jesus' final visit to Jerusalem was intended to share his divine message, but he faced rejection and was executed, a fate similar to prophets before him. Jesus opposed the primitive practice of sacrificial offerings, teaching instead that God desires the well-being and happiness of his children.\nThe misunderstanding about Jesus' death as a final sacrificial offering was introduced by Paul in an effort to win over the Jews and their long-held practice of sacrificing animals for God. However, it is contrary to Jesus' teachings about God\u2019s unconditional love and forgiveness. God's love has never been contingent on sacrificing an animal or human to appease him."

The apostles Peter and John, along with Joseph of Arimathea and David Zebedee, also inspected the tomb and found it as described by the women.\nThe chief of archangels was granted permission to accelerate the dissolution of Jesus' physical remains to prevent decay, effectively making the tomb empty through this unique celestial process.

    "fullSummary": "Jesus Christ is a name that is commonly used to describe the person known as Jesus of Nazareth. However, this name is used primarily by Christians in connection with the Christian gospel. It is based on the fact of God as the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ in association with the experience of believers in fellowship with the risen and glorified Christ. The title \"Christ\" is derived from the Greek \"Christos,\" which means the anointed one.\nIn this article, the terms \"Jesus of Nazareth\" and \"Creator Son\" will be used interchangeably with the term \"Jesus Christ.\" The term \"Christ Michael\" will also be used to designate the person who we know as Jesus of Nazareth. In God\u2019s universe government, there is a classification of beings known as the \"order of Michael.\" \"Michael\" is a title used by the universe government to designate the Creator Sons of God. There are many beings on the order of Michael in God\u2019s grand universe of many universes, but Christ Michael of Nebadon (the name of our local universe) is our \"only begotten Son.\"\n\"Michael\" derives from the Latin \u2018\"micare,\" to shine or glitter.

    "fullSummary": "Jesus had a deep love for music, especially playing the harp. Little known to the modern world, Jesus became a skilled harpist by age eleven and enjoyed entertaining his family, friends, and neighbors with his beautiful music during the evenings, especially in the winter months. Jesus also promoted an interest in vocal music among his friends. Music was a way for Jesus to express himself and bring joy to others.\nWhen he was fifteen years old, a tax collector threatened to confiscate his harp to extract additional revenue. In Jesus' nineteenth year, he sold his harp to secure the funds to send his brother Jude to school. This was a willing sacrifice Jesus made to care for his father Joseph's family. But the loss of the harp took away a source of joy and comfort that Jesus cherished during his mortal life. Even so, Jesus found solace in other ways. In later years he would often go to a hill he loved as a child and reminisce about his childhood days in Nazareth. These memories helped him find strength and prepared him for the challenges that were ahead.\nJesus' love for music and his skill with the harp were a part of his life and this can make him feel closer and more accessible, reminding us that he lived a life filled with many of the same passions and pleasures that enrich our own experiences during our lives."

    "fullSummary": "One of the most effective means that Jesus used to teach the truths of the kingdom was the parable method. Parables are simple stories, often having to do with nature, that illustrate a moral or spiritual truth. While Jesus had previously used parables, it was during his third public preaching tour that he started to frequently utilize this method with the masses. Once, when a group of about one thousand people were gathered to hear Jesus speak, Peter offered to speak to them. But Jesus said: \"No, Peter, I will tell them a story.\" And with that, Jesus told the Parable of the Sower.\nFollowing this event, Jesus shared the benefits of using parables with his apostles. Jesus chose to teach in parables primarily to engage the imagination, provoke reflection, and inspire decision-making in his listeners. Parables allowed him to present profound spiritual truths in relatable stories that were simple on the surface but deep in meaning, making his teachings accessible to everyone regardless of their educational background or social status. This method also served to conceal or veil the meanings of his teachings from those who were opposed to him, sought to trap him, or who were otherwise not genuinely interested in spiritual growth.\nThe following is a synopsis of each of the 32 parables that Jesus employed in his ministry.

It is not strange that Jesus should be interested in someday returning to the planet where he experienced life as a mortal of the realm. It is only natural to believe that Jesus would be interested in coming back, not only once but even many times to the world where he lived such a unique life and won for himself universe sovereignty, power, and authority. On numerous occasions and to many individuals, Jesus declared his intention of returning to this world.\nWhen Jesus lived on earth, he studied scripture as a boy, and he knew the quotes that referred to the Messiah as returning in the clouds could not be about him as he lived in mortal form. He discounted that the quotes were referring to him at that time. He turned these things over in his mind and as he grew into manhood and fully realized who he was, he regained the memory of who he was before the incarnation. Gradually he became clearer in his understanding and by the day of his baptism in the Jordan River, he was shown a vision of heavenly grandeur that forever removed all doubt about his mission and destiny.

These are a few of what one might consider \"human rights.\" Jesus was concerned at times with all of these. He saw the wrongs in his society then, even as we see some of the same wrongs today.\nWe know that Jesus was not someone who engaged in civil disobedience; he did not take a stand on issues of his day. He steered clear of the political arena, and he was most concerned about the spiritual life of the individual, not necessarily social justice. But when he did talk about social issues, he voiced his strongest criticisms about pride, cruelty, ill-treatment of the poor, and hypocrisy.\nJesus participated in daily activities and commerce without aiming to revolutionize the economic system, although he frequently pointed out the injustice of unfair wealth distribution.

He died on Friday afternoon, and he arose from the tomb in the early hours of Sunday morning.\nJesus\u2019 resurrection from the dead was the single event that most influenced the subsequent narrative of his life and the event that effectively eclipsed and obscured his original teachings. The Christian gospel became the gospel of the Risen Christ, replacing the gospel that Jesus taught on the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of all mankind. The fact that Jesus arose on the third day and subsequently appeared in a different form to nearly one thousand eyewitnesses over the next forty days was indeed an astonishing occurrence.\nJesus\u2019 resurrection was accomplished through the inherent power in himself; no other personality assisted him. When Jesus emerged unseen from the tomb, he was embodied in a new form midway between material and spirit existence.

The old religion is one of fear of the unknown; the new gospel is a conviction of the truth that God is good and working with us for our survival and glorious eternal future with him. In the kingdom, the more we trust God, the more our fear disappears. Jesus emphasized the profound shift from fearing a punitive deity to embracing a loving Father, highlighting that true understanding of God's nature dispels fear and fosters a relationship based on love and mutual respect. This relationship transforms our approach to life's challenges, steering us away from fear towards a life characterized by faith and confidence in God's goodness."

    "shortSummary": "Jesus teaches that marriage is foundational to a healthy society and emphasizes the civil, not sacramental, nature of marriage. He supports equitable divorce to avoid worse outcomes and highlights the significant spiritual and developmental roles of parenting.",
    "fullSummary": "In Jesus' teachings, marriage is highlighted as the pinnacle of human relationships and a foundation for a healthy society, where respect for family life enhances the status of women and children. He advocates that marriage is a civil institution, evolved through human history, not a sacrament, and emphasizes the importance of parental roles in the nurturing and spiritual growth of children.\nWhile addressing the issue of divorce, Jesus advocated for it as a necessary societal function to prevent worse outcomes, rejecting the notion of marriage\u2019s divine indissolubility and emphasizing equality in marital dissolution. His teachings suggest that divorce, though not ideal, must be managed with realistic approaches and mutual effort, promoting fairness and the well-being of all parties involved.\nRearing children is essential for all, contributing significantly to both the child's spiritual development and the parents' growth, shaping their journey and relationship with the divine. Parental involvement is crucial in teaching children about love, trust, and values, preparing them for their spiritual progression, and fostering environments that encourage spiritual growth in natural settings."

    "shortSummary": "Jesus chose the full experience of a human life and natural death is a part of that life experience. Though natural events thrust a painful and humiliating death upon him, he met death with courage and chose to not use his divine power to escape the situation.",
    "fullSummary": "To appreciate the meaning of the death on the cross, you must first consider the meaning of the life Jesus lived. Jesus desired to live a mortal life in the flesh to gain a full and sympathetic understanding of the intense struggle mankind must endure; and to reveal the true, loving nature of our heavenly Father. He championed the cause of living the perfect will of God \u2013 and he became the pinnacle of what is humanly possible \u2013 what a person can achieve physically, intellectually, and spiritually in just one short lifetime. Jesus chose the full experience of a human life, and natural death is a part of that life experience. Though the course of natural events thrust a painful and humiliating death upon him, he met death with courage just as every other person must do when their hour comes. He did not use his human or divine power to escape the situation, not even his powers of persuasion, because others cannot expect a divine intervention in their final moments. The lessons Jesus taught, the matchless life he lived, and his living revelation of the true nature of God were his gifts to the world and for an entire universe.\nIt is important to note that Jesus would have risen to new life on the third day following his death regardless of how he ended his mortal existence. Jesus\u2019 resurrection was a startling and powerful demonstration of the truth he had long taught his followers about the promise of eternal life. The post-resurrection appearances gave Jesus the opportunity to further instruct and extend a personal farewell to each of them; providing them with new strength, courage, devotion, certainty, and resolve to carry on in service, to live by the Father\u2019s will, and to establish the kingdom of heaven even in his absence."

    "fullSummary": "The mistakes made by Jesus\u2019 early followers were not intentional. They were only misunderstandings of his teachings and the impact of the awe-inspiring events that occurred during and after his extraordinary life. It was natural that these early teachers proclaim the resurrected Jesus, a God-man who died yet lived. And they mistook what he said about his \"second coming,\" thinking he would return during their lifetime.\nThe idea that God demanded Jesus\u2019 life as a ransom for humanity\u2019s alleged sin fit well with the long-established sacrificial beliefs of the times in which he lived. Little did his early followers realize such a concept made God appear to subsequent generations as a heartless and blood-thirsty tyrant. And that belief would become a great stumbling block for many deep-thinking men and women. Many truth-seekers cannot conceive of a good God who would demand that his son submit to such a cruel ordeal to appease his Father\u2019s presumed wrath for humans\u2019 supposed sinfulness.\nBeliefs about the sacrificial and resurrected Jesus displaced the Master\u2019s sublime teachings that God is a loving Father of a universal family of sisters and brothers. The religion about Jesus, which evolved after his death, often overshadows the religion of Jesus \u2013 his actual teachings and living example \u2013 but in time, his true message will prevail."

    "fullSummary": "During the Last Supper, Jesus had the sad task of telling his apostles that he would soon leave them. He tried to prepare them for the trials to come and let them know that he would still be with them as the Spirit of Truth. He told them that his physical presence had to leave the earth so that his spirit presence could come to them and be with them forever.\nHe told them that the Spirit of Truth would glorify him, just as he had glorified the Father; that it would not speak of himself but would reveal things that God had shown to him and even things to come. He said that the spirit would come forth from him and would reveal his truth to them.\nHe told them that they would be sorrowful when he died, but that he would come back for a short time and speak clearly to them. And he assured them that his triumphant resurrection from the dead would be a blessing for them and for all worlds.

    "fullSummary": "The religion of personal spiritual experience is the religion that Jesus himself practiced, and the religion that he taught to his followers. This revolutionary religion is based on the reality of personal spiritual experience with God in connection to the gospel of the kingdom: The reality of the Fatherhood of God and the resulting reality of the brotherhood of all mankind. Jesus founded the religion of personal experience in doing the will of God the Father and serving the human brotherhood.\nIn the years subsequent to his life, crucifixion, and resurrection, this religion OF Jesus was transformed into the religion ABOUT Jesus, i.e., the religion of the risen Christ. But to really follow Jesus, while one may preach a religion about him, one must inevitably live the religion that he himself taught and lived.\nJesus\u2019 personal religion is rendered practical for the individual when it is based on the gospel of the kingdom: The reality of the Fatherhood of God, and the resulting corollary, the brotherhood of mankind. But first, we must discover God in order to enjoy personal spiritual experience with him. God lives within each of us as a guiding Spirit presence and Jesus understood and taught this reality.

    "fullSummary": "A secular society is one that ignores God, and totalitarianism is an unrestrained dictatorship. Secular totalitarianism is a futile philosophy that replaces God with materialism. Atheistic materialism cannot satisfy the innate and natural human hunger for God. Attempts to create a society without God are like building a home without a foundation.\nWith secular totalitarian rule, empires will eventually collapse, and wars will continue to devastate nations until a common Creator is recognized and appreciated for the gifts of living.

    "fullSummary": "Mystery cults were well established across Eurasia and North Africa when Jesus was born. They were rooted in Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Persian cultures. They involved magic, astrology, emperor worship, mythology, ceremonials, and sacrificial rites. Their primary appeal was a belief in life after death.\nIt was on this spiritual foundation that Christianity was erected. Paul, in establishing his version of Christianity, made compromises with the mystery religions to win converts. One of these compromises remains deeply entrenched within modern Christianity, the date of Jesus\u2019 birth, December twenty-fifth. This was the most celebrated of all days by one of the largest mystery cults, Mithraism.\nPaul felt he had to make these adaptations to the teachings of Jesus to render them more acceptable to a larger audience. His version of Christianity, like the mystery religions, offered salvation from death, and it also promised deliverance from sorrow and sin, followed by the endowment of a righteous character of eternal survival qualities. In contrast, while the mystery cults were built upon myths and secrets, Christianity was founded on historical facts \u2013 specifically, the life and teachings of Jesus, Son of Man and Son of God."

Mark\u2019s Gospel was greatly influenced by the apostle Simon Peter, who urged Mark to write it soon after Peter's death in 67 CE. It has undergone numerous changes.\nAlthough attributed to Matthew, the book of Matthew was not written by him but by Isador, a disciple of Matthew. This work was based on Matthew\u2019s personal remembrances of Jesus, including some of the sayings of the Master that he wrote down after Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.

The Paradise Trinity represents the unity of Deity, a unity that is eternally grounded in the absolute oneness of three original, co-equal, and coexistent personalities: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. The Trinity resides on Paradise.\nWhen we look back into the infinite past, the only inescapable, inevitable certainty in the universe is the Paradise Trinity.

Jesus' home in Galilee provided an example of a nurturing environment that fostered strong, balanced moral character, self-reliance, and loyalty. Love, selflessness, and wisdom are foundational in contemporary family life. The profound impact of parental love and guidance on a child's spiritual and emotional well-being ultimately shapes their life trajectory. Creating such homes is a crucial parental responsibility and requires education and training to be truly prepared for the most important task a person can ever undertake \u2013 parenting.\nThe home is the basic institution of civilization, and the methods whereby Jesus assisted Mary in raising their family after his father Joseph's death, in addition to other comments he made about the ideal family, give us a wealth of information to consider how we might better maintain a healthy family life and be wise parents in modern times. The love, devotion, and wisdom within a home have a profound influence on religion, and true religion, in turn, enhances the home. Today, the human race has a rich social and cultural heritage, and it should be wisely and effectively passed on to succeeding generations.

We may not understand it in its fullness, but we can be assured that whatever our understanding of the personality of God, he cannot be anything less than the concept that we are able to grasp. God can know and be known, love and be loved just as any person can know and love another. As Jesus once said to Thomas, \"It matters little what idea of the Father you may entertain as long as you are spiritually acquainted with the ideal of his infinite and eternal nature.\"\nWe can see the personality of God in his Creator Sons. Jesus of Nazareth is the perfect example of someone who told us that when we had seen him, we had seen the Father. Through his life, he revealed the personality of God.\nIt is the personality of God that reveals his unity. Personality is spread throughout the universe, but it is centered in the Universal Father, who IS personality.

    "fullSummary": "Sincere and growing faith leads to genuine religious experience that confirms God is real. Jesus taught that God is a loving spiritual father, a divine presence living within. The great challenge of life is, through faith, to achieve better communication with this indwelling presence. Making contact with God is the greatest of all life\u2019s adventures and the most rewarding of all experiences; it is religion in its purest form.\nFaith, properly applied, leads to spirit consciousness, and such consciousness teaches that humans are God\u2019s children. Faith guides the child of God to God-consciousness, the equivalent of integrating the self with the universe, and on its highest levels of spirit reality. Jesus demonstrated faith\u2019s maximum strength, enough to overcome doubt and the troubles of the world, even death.\nFaith is a gift of God that reveals God\u2019s actual presence. Logic leads to the idea that there must be a creator of such a vast and complex universe, it is faith founded in logic and reason. Through internal personal religious experience and external revelation, faith reveals that God is within and is a loving, infinite, and eternal personality."

    "fullSummary": "In the first century after Christ, the Western world witnessed a resurgence in spiritual thought and religious fervor, setting the stage for the emergence of Christianity. This era was marked by the pervasive influence of Greek culture and philosophy, creating a conducive environment for the spread of new religious ideas. The Jewish people, dispersed across various regions, played a pivotal role in propagating this emerging faith, with their central temple in Jerusalem serving as a cornerstone for their monotheistic beliefs. Within the gentile world, Christianity found its footing among the lower classes and slaves, offering a message of moral redemption and salvation in contrast to established pagan practices and philosophies.\nThe prevalent philosophies and religions of the time, including mystery religions and philosophical schools, influenced the development of early Christianity. The adaptations made by early Christian leaders, particularly Paul, allowed this new faith to appeal to a broader audience and ultimately led to its rise in a culturally diverse and interconnected world."

    "shortSummary": "Jesus spent the last eight years of his life training his followers through personal and public instruction across the Mediterranean and Palestine, developing a training method that combined example, dialogue, practical experience, and parables.",
    "fullSummary": "The last eight years of Jesus\u2019 life were a training period for his believers, beginning in April of 22 CE, with a tour around the Mediterranean. On that tour, he taught individuals he sought out in Rome and other stops along the way. In January of 26 CE, he began training groups of men and women in his homeland, Palestine. These two phases of training, private and public, created a foundation for the religion about Jesus that came into being following his death.\nJesus\u2019 training method was fourfold, he taught by example, by question and answer, by actual experience, and by parables. Jesus lived his sublime teachings and that was perhaps his most effective way of training his apostles and disciples. But he was also feared for what he taught and the miracles he performed. The religious authorities were afraid of a divine being claiming to be a \"Son of man and a Son of God,\" someone with such power. He paid with his life for his words and deeds. Despite this resistance, his teachings lived on in those he so thoroughly trained, the many messengers who adored him and carried his saving gospel to the world."

    "fullSummary": "During the tour of the Mediterranean regions, Jesus, Gonod, and Ganid spent some time in Rome. It was during this time that Jesus talked with Angamon, who was a leader of the Stoics. On one occasion, Jesus and Angamon talked through the night on the topic of true values.\nOn another occasion, while he was in Athens, Jesus spoke of this issue of real values during a talk with a Greek philosopher. On several other occasions, Jesus reiterated the importance of achieving a balance between the material and the spiritual aspects of life in order to discern true values.\nThe practice of true religion \u2013 the reality of true spiritual experience with God \u2013 aids the believer in discovering the true supernatural values of truth, goodness, and beauty for themselves."

    "shortSummary": "Mary and Joseph had Jesus through natural biological means, making Jesus' birth non-miraculous in biological terms. However, what distinguishes Jesus is the divine choice of incarnation at the moment of conception, embodying full divinity in a human baby.",
    "fullSummary": "Mary was a virgin and subsequently married Joseph, and their firstborn was Jesus. When she became pregnant, Joseph was Jesus' biological father, making the birth non-miraculous in biological terms. What made him different is that the Son of God chose this baby in which to incarnate. Through a phenomenon that was a miracle, an entirely human baby also attained the state of being fully divine at the moment of conception. In total, Mary brought nine children into the world and all were born through the normal biological process.\nThroughout history, many people have claimed that their most important leaders were born of virgins; their careers are filled with miraculous events, and their return is always anticipated by their respective followers. While the New Testament's Gospel of Matthew cites a virgin birth for Jesus, other texts like the Gospels of Mark, John, Luke, and the writings of Paul attribute his lineage to Joseph, suggesting a natural birth that aligns with human lineage."

    "fullSummary": "Jesus, in addressing a wealthy Roman's inquiry about managing wealth, outlined a comprehensive philosophy emphasizing stewardship, fairness, and the moral obligations accompanying riches. He classified wealth into ten categories, including inherited, discovered, trade, unfair, interest, genius, accidental, stolen, trust funds, and earned wealth, offering specific guidance for each to ensure ethical accumulation and distribution. Jesus advocated for justice, equity, and generosity, urging the wealthy man to administer his wealth with a focus on the betterment of society and future generations, highlighting the importance of balancing material wealth with spiritual values.\nIn his teachings, Jesus did not condemn wealth itself but critiqued the unfair distribution and exploitation associated with it. He underscored the spiritual dangers of prioritizing material riches over eternal values, illustrating this through parables and teachings that stressed generosity, the temporal nature of worldly possessions, and the paramount importance of being \"rich toward God.\" Jesus' perspective on wealth was rooted in a vision of social justice where material resources are managed as a means to serve higher spiritual ends, advocating for a life where wealth serves as a tool for good, not an end in itself."

    "fullSummary": "Death of the body and mind is not the end. During life on earth, a soul is created, and this soul is what lives on. Spiritual values and personal relationships are the essence and substance of the soul. The soul leaves the body behind and resurrects nearby on the mansion worlds where it inhabits a new and indestructible body, an angel-like form. Jesus referred to the mansion worlds when he said: \"In my Father\u2019s house are many mansions.\"\nSoul survivors will remember and be remembered by those they knew in their earthly lives. Their personalities will be the same in the next life. Death is the doorway to the next stage of life, where those who died before us will greet us and teach us about life on the mansion worlds, the first of many heavens."

    "fullSummary": "The soul is an exclusively spiritual human acquisition that forever separates human beings from all other living beings. The soul is self-reflective, truth-discerning, and spirit-perceiving. The foundation of the soul is the individual\u2019s moral consciousness, and it is this moral self-consciousness that determines the potential for eternal survival of the soul. The soul exists and grows only in relation to moral thinking and spiritual progress. If the soul stops growing, it dies.\nProgress in soul growth is aided by the Thought Adjuster, the literal presence of God in the mind. The Thought Adjuster comes to dwell in the mind of every individual at the time of that individual\u2019s first moral choice, usually at about five years of age. The coming of the Adjuster signifies the birth of the soul, but the soul is distinct from the indwelling spirit.\nOver a lifetime, the growth of the soul is either helped or hindered by the moral choices made by the individual. This moral consciousness is evolutionary and improves with experience. The closer the alliance between the moral consciousness and the indwelling adjuster, the more the soul grows and the surer the possibility of eternal survival of that soul. All conflict requiring choice has to do with maintaining harmony between the intellectual consciousness and the moral consciousness."

    "shortSummary": "Judas nurtured a suspicious and individualistic nature. He was material-minded, blamed others, had a vengeful attitude, and isolated himself. Despite being faithful in financial matters, these tendencies led to his ultimate betrayal of Jesus.",
    "fullSummary": "Judas Iscariot was a tragic figure. As an apostle, he was assigned to be the keeper of the purse and, in this task, he excelled. He was always faithful to his apostolic duties insofar as money and finances were concerned. But in his personality, he had flaws that kept him from engaging in the spirit of comradeship with Jesus and his fellow apostles. He could have overcome these flaws but he never made the effort to grow in spiritual progress, which would have been to his benefit.\nHis main issue was that he found it difficult to confide in Jesus or his brother apostles. He had a suspicious nature that he nurtured, rather than trying to subdue it. He was extremely individualistic: he thought very highly of himself and resisted correction. When he did ask for advice, it was generally to those who were indifferent or shared his resistance to spiritual growth.\nJudas was a poor loser and he was not socially-minded. He was overly ambitious for material reward and tended to blame others but never himself. He had a vengeful attitude and liked to \"get even\" with those he imagined had wronged him. He did not care to share his problems with others \u2013 even Jesus \u2013 who loved him. And all of these tendencies built on themselves in his inner life until he was destroyed by lonely despair."

    "fullSummary": "Jesus\u2019 teaching method evolved over his lifetime. When he was fourteen, his father was killed in an accident. As the eldest son, he took on the role of head of the family until age twenty-two when his brother James assumed that role. During these eight years, he taught, trained, and parented his eight siblings, individually and at family conferences. He emphasized practical, positive actions over prohibitions and used questions to engage in meaningful dialogue.\nIn his public preaching, Jesus challenged existing conventions and was inclusive in his outreach. He emphasized the importance of respecting individual personalities, promoting self-respect, and avoiding negative tactics such as sarcasm, cynicism, and fear-inducing methods. Jesus advocated for a teaching approach that is empowering and centered on building a personal relationship with God. He stressed the importance of focusing on positive truths and avoiding the critique of misunderstandings.\nWhen speaking to groups, Jesus wisely adapted his discourses to the needs and capacities of his hearers. Still later, when his teachings came into conflict with religious authorities, he began using stories and parables to convey his lessons. At the heart of Jesus' teaching method was the principle of divine love, setting a timeless standard for compassionate and constructive spiritual instruction."

His birth is historically significant, noted for the traditional Jewish rites that followed, including circumcision and naming on the eighth day. The narrative of the Star of Bethlehem, which traditionally led the Magi to Jesus, is derived from notable astronomical events, including a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in 7 BCE.

    "fullSummary": "Life can sometimes seem unfair and challenging. It is natural to wonder why we face difficult situations. The truth is, we live in an imperfect and evolving world that is designed to provide each of us with free will and the ability to choose between good and evil. This freedom is vital for gaining experience and learning, even if it means that we will be confronted with unfair life situations. However, it is important to remember that we are not alone in facing these challenges. Throughout history, many people have also experienced unfairness and adversity. Even Jesus faced many difficult situations during his time on earth.\nUnfairness and suffering are not punishments from God. God loves each and every one of us unconditionally. He does not cause our suffering, but he can help us find strength and meaning in the midst of it. We can find comfort in knowing that God is always with us. He understands our pain and is ready to offer us guidance, comfort, and strength. Through prayer and seeking a personal relationship with God, we can find solace and the ability to overcome life's challenges. It is a well-known fact that people grow in strength of character when rising to the challenges of adversity.\nBecause we live in a world of time and space where we have the freedom to make choices, sometimes the choices we make, or the choices made by others, can affect us in negative ways. We are equally faced with challenges created by living life in the midst of an imperfect world. Remember that even in the face of unfair situations, we have the power to choose how we respond. We can choose to grow stronger, to show kindness and compassion, and to seek justice. By doing so, we can make a difference in the world and bring about positive change."

The religious authorities feared the crowd, who were mainly curious about Jesus, allowing him to enter the city freely without immediate arrest.

    "fullSummary": "The main distinction between worship and prayer is that worship is done for its own sake, while prayer incorporates an element of self-interest. True worship involves no personal interest or self-request; rather, it is simply a celebration of God as we understand him. Worship makes no demands and has no expectations.\nBoth worship and prayer are essential aspects of religious experience, but worship results in more profound communion and reflective enrichment of the mind. Words are irrelevant to both prayer and worship. Instead, it is the motivating thought and the spiritual content that validates the outreach.\nOne of the problems of modern life is that people think they're too busy for spiritual meditation and religious devotion. Instead, there is concern with many things that are devoid of spiritual values, sanctions, and satisfactions, as well as faith, hope, and eternal assurances. The great challenge to modern society is to achieve better communication with the divine spirit that dwells within the human mind."
