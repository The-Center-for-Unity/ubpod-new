## Testing Results Summary

### Route Testing Progress
We have confirmed that all routes are loading correctly, including dynamic routes for series and episodes. The application's routing system is working properly after our cleanup, which means we haven't broken any of the page navigation functionality.

Navigation between series and episode pages is functioning correctly, and legacy URLs are properly redirecting to the new format. The next step is to complete the audio player functionality testing.
