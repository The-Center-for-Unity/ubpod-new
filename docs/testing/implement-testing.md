# Testing Implementation Process

## Phase 1: Testing Infrastructure Setup

This plan focuses exclusively on setting up the testing infrastructure without modifying any application code. All changes will be isolated to new test-specific files and package.json updates.

### Implementation Plan

#### Step 1: Install Testing Dependencies
```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest-environment-jsdom identity-obj-proxy ts-jest
```
**Safety note**: These are dev dependencies only, will not affect production builds.

#### Step 2: Create Jest Configuration
Create a new file `jest.config.js` in the project root:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.(css|less|scss|sass)$': 'identity-obj-proxy',
    '\\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp|svg)$': '<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js'
  },
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$': ['ts-jest']
  },
  // Avoid processing node_modules
  transformIgnorePatterns: ['/node_modules/'],
  // Avoid test timeouts with audio elements
  testTimeout: 10000
};
```
**Safety note**: Config exists in isolation from application code.

#### Step 3: Create Jest Setup File
Create a new file `jest.setup.js` in the project root:
```javascript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';

// Mock HTML Media Element for audio tests
// This prevents actual audio playback during tests without modifying app code
window.HTMLMediaElement.prototype.load = jest.fn();
window.HTMLMediaElement.prototype.play = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined);
window.HTMLMediaElement.prototype.pause = jest.fn();
Object.defineProperty(window.HTMLMediaElement.prototype, 'currentTime', {
  writable: true,
  value: 0
});
Object.defineProperty(window.HTMLMediaElement.prototype, 'duration', {
  writable: true,
  value: 100
});
```
**Safety note**: Only affects the test environment, not actual code.

#### Step 4: Create File Mock
Create directory and file `__mocks__/fileMock.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = 'test-file-stub';
```
**Safety note**: Only used during tests to handle imports of media files.

#### Step 5: Set Up Test Utilities
Create directory and file `src/__tests__/utils/test-utils.tsx`:
```tsx
import React, { ReactElement } from 'react';
import { render, RenderOptions } from '@testing-library/react';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

// Custom renderer that includes providers
const customRender = (
  ui: ReactElement,
  options?: Omit<RenderOptions, 'wrapper'>
) => render(ui, { wrapper: ({ children }) => (
  <BrowserRouter>{children}</BrowserRouter>
), ...options });

// Re-export everything
export * from '@testing-library/react';

// Override render method
export { customRender as render };
```
**Safety note**: No application code is modified, only testing helpers created.

#### Step 6: Update package.json Scripts
Add these scripts to package.json:
```json
"scripts": {
  // Keep existing scripts...
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch",
  "test:coverage": "jest --coverage"
}
```
**Safety note**: Only adds new scripts without modifying existing ones.

#### Step 7: Create a Sample Test to Verify Setup
Create a basic empty test to verify the infrastructure is working correctly:

Create file `src/__tests__/setup.test.ts`:
```typescript
describe('Test setup verification', () => {
  test('Jest is configured correctly', () => {
    expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);
  });
});
```
**Safety note**: Just verifies Jest works without touching any real components.

### Safety Guarantees:

1. ✅ **No Application Code Modifications**: All files created or modified are either new test files or package.json scripts.
2. ✅ **Isolation from Production**: Test files and configurations are completely separate from the application code.
3. ✅ **No Build Changes**: The testing setup won't affect your production builds.
4. ✅ **No Runtime Changes**: These changes have zero impact on how the application runs for users.
5. ✅ **Reversibility**: If any issues arise, simply discard the branch and nothing changes in your main codebase.

## Implementation Progress

### [May 1, 2024] - Phase 1 Implementation

#### Step 1: Install Testing Dependencies
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Notes: All required testing libraries have been installed successfully.

#### Step 2: Create Jest Configuration
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Notes: Created jest.config.cjs with proper configuration for the project.

#### Step 3: Create Jest Setup File
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Notes: Created jest.setup.cjs with HTML Media Element mocks and TextEncoder/TextDecoder polyfills.

#### Step 4: Create File Mock
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Notes: Created file and style mocks in the __mocks__ directory.

#### Step 5: Set Up Test Utilities
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Notes: Created custom render function that wraps components in MemoryRouter for tests.

#### Step 6: Update package.json Scripts
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Notes: Added test, test:watch, and test:coverage scripts.

#### Step 7: Create a Sample Test to Verify Setup
- Status: ✅ Completed
- Notes: Created and verified basic tests for components.

### Insights and Observations

- Jest configuration was updated to use CommonJS format (.cjs extension) to align with the Vite project setup.
- Added TextEncoder/TextDecoder polyfills to handle React Router's requirements in the test environment.
- Created a custom test renderer that supports route-specific testing with MemoryRouter.
- Initial component tests demonstrate successful rendering and attribute verification.
- All tests are now passing, proving the test infrastructure is working correctly.

## Next Steps

### Framework Migration: Vite to Next.js

Based on strategic recommendations, we'll be migrating the application from Vite to Next.js before proceeding with Phases 2-5 of the testing implementation. This decision is based on the following considerations:

1. **Testing Efficiency**: Next.js provides a more integrated testing experience with its framework
2. **Avoid Redundant Work**: Implementing extensive tests before migration would require significant rework
3. **Improved Testing Tools**: Next.js offers built-in testing utilities that will enhance our testing capabilities

#### Migration Plan

1. Complete the framework migration from Vite to Next.js
2. Adapt the existing testing infrastructure to work with Next.js
3. Resume the testing implementation with Phase 2 once the migration is complete

The testing foundation established in Phase 1 will still be valuable, though some adjustments will be needed to align with Next.js conventions.

### Phase 2: Component Testing (On Hold)

*This phase will commence after the Next.js migration is complete*

### Phase 3: Integration Testing

After component testing, we'll implement integration tests focusing on:

1. User flows through the application
2. Data fetching and processing
3. Audio playback lifecycle
4. Route transitions and state preservation

Each phase will maintain our safety-first approach, ensuring tests don't affect production code.
