## Key Features

The UrantiaBookPod application provides:

1. **Audio Podcast Experience**: Listen to AI-generated narrations of the Urantia Book
2. **Series Organization**: Content organized into thematic series
3. **Dynamic Navigation**: Easy browsing of papers and episodes
4. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
5. **Accessibility**: Designed with accessibility in mind

## Architecture Overview

The application is built with:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics

The architecture follows a component-based approach with clean separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── components/  # Reusable UI components
├── pages/       # Page components
├── hooks/       # Custom React hooks
├── utils/       # Utility functions
├── types/       # TypeScript type definitions
└── constants/   # Application constants
```

## Development Workflow

The recommended development workflow is:

1. Set up your development environment (see [Developer Guide](./development/developer-guide.md))
2. Create a feature branch for your changes
3. Implement and test your changes
4. Submit a pull request for review

For a detailed approach to adding new features without breaking existing functionality, see the [Feature Development with Regression Testing](./testing/Feature-Development-with-Regression-Testing.md) guide.

## Content Management

The application serves audio content that is:

1. Generated from Urantia Book text using AI voice technology
2. Organized into topical series and episodes
3. Stored in a CDN for fast delivery
4. Presented with synchronized text for reading along

For details on how content is managed, see the [Content Pipeline](./content/content-pipeline.md) documentation.

## Testing

The application includes a comprehensive [Testing Plan](./testing/testing-plan.md) that covers:

1. Route Testing
2. Audio Player Testing
3. Series Navigation Testing
4. Content Display Testing
5. Contact Form Testing
6. Performance Testing

For a detailed approach to safely implementing automated tests, see the [Automated Testing Implementation Plan](./testing/automated-testing-implementation-plan.md).
