# CI/CD Primer for UrantiaBookPod

## What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**. It's a set of practices that automates the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and delivering them to production.

## Why Use CI/CD?

1. **Catch Issues Early**: Automated tests run on every change
2. **Consistent Deployments**: Same process every time, reducing human error
3. **Faster Releases**: Automate manual steps in the deployment process
4. **Better Collaboration**: Teams can integrate their work frequently
5. **Reliable Rollbacks**: Easily revert to previous versions if issues arise

## CI/CD Components

### Continuous Integration (CI)

CI is the practice of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository, with automated testing to detect problems early.

**Key Components:**
- **Automated Building**: Compile code and create artifacts
- **Automated Testing**: Run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- **Code Quality Checks**: Linting, formatting, and security scanning

### Continuous Delivery (CD)

CD extends CI by automatically preparing code for release to production, though the actual deployment requires manual approval.

**Key Components:**
- **Environment Deployments**: Automated deployments to testing/staging
- **Deployment Verification**: Tests in production-like environments
- **Release Preparation**: Version tagging, changelogs, etc.

### Continuous Deployment

Continuous Deployment takes automation one step further by automatically deploying to production when all tests pass.

## CI/CD for UrantiaBookPod

### Getting Started with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform integrated directly into GitHub, making it easy to automate workflows right from your repository.

#### Basic GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a file in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: UrantiaBookPod CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ code-only, main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ code-only, main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Lint
      run: npm run lint
    
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
    
    - name: Test
      run: npm test
```

This workflow will:
1. Run whenever code is pushed to `code-only` or `main` branches
2. Run whenever a pull request is opened against these branches
3. Set up a Node.js environment
4. Install dependencies
5. Run linting
6. Build the application
7. Run tests

### Adding Continuous Deployment

To automatically deploy to Vercel or another provider after CI passes:

```yaml
name: UrantiaBookPod CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ code-only, main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ code-only, main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Lint
      run: npm run lint
    
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
    
    - name: Test
      run: npm test

  deploy:
    needs: build
    if: success() && github.ref == 'refs/heads/code-only'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Deploy to Vercel
      uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
      with:
        vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
        vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
        vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
        vercel-args: '--prod'
```

This adds a deployment job that:
1. Only runs if the build job succeeds
2. Only deploys when changes are pushed to the `code-only` branch
3. Uses Vercel's GitHub Action to deploy automatically

## Best Practices for CI/CD

1. **Keep Builds Fast**: Aim for under 10 minutes total
2. **Test Pyramid**: Lots of unit tests, fewer integration tests, even fewer E2E tests
3. **Fail Fast**: Run quick checks first (linting, unit tests)
4. **Environment Parity**: Make testing environments as similar to production as possible
5. **Secure Secrets**: Never commit tokens or credentials to your repository
6. **Versioning**: Tag releases with semantic versioning
7. **Monitor Deployments**: Track performance and errors after deploying

## Setting Up CI/CD for UrantiaBookPod

### Step 1: Add Tests

Before setting up CI/CD, ensure you have:
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for key features
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Actions

1. Create `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Add workflow YAML files for different processes
3. Configure branch protection rules to require CI to pass

### Step 3: Set Up Deployment

1. Generate API tokens from your hosting provider
2. Add tokens as GitHub repository secrets
3. Configure deployment workflow to use these secrets

### Step 4: Monitor and Iterate

1. Watch CI/CD logs for issues
2. Optimize slow steps in your pipeline
3. Add more automated tests over time

## Advanced CI/CD Topics

- **Matrix Testing**: Test across multiple Node.js versions
- **Caching**: Speed up builds by caching dependencies
- **Parallel Jobs**: Run tests in parallel
- **Scheduled Workflows**: Run security scans on a schedule
- **Environment-Specific Deployments**: Different configs for staging vs production
- **Feature Flags**: Deploy code that's not yet activated
- **Canary Releases**: Deploy to a subset of users first
- **Rollback Strategies**: Automate recovery from failed deployments

## CI/CD Tools Beyond GitHub Actions

- **Jenkins**: Self-hosted, highly customizable
- **CircleCI**: Cloud-based, good for complex workflows
- **Travis CI**: Simple setup for open-source projects
- **GitLab CI**: Integrated with GitLab repositories
- **Azure DevOps**: Microsoft's CI/CD solution
- **AWS CodePipeline**: AWS-native CI/CD
