# UBPod Translation Review Guide

Welcome to the UBPod translation review system! This guide will help you review and improve the automated translations.

## Getting Started

1. **Access the Spreadsheet**
   - You should have received an email invitation to edit the spreadsheet
   - Open the spreadsheet link from the email
   - You'll see multiple sheets (tabs) at the bottom

2. **Understanding the Layout**
   
   Each row contains:
   - **Column A (Path)**: The location of this text in the app
   - **Column B (English Original)**: The source English text
   - **Column C (Current Translation)**: The automated translation from DeepL
   - **Column D (Proposed Translation)**: YOUR EDITS GO HERE
   - **Column E (Status)**: Set to "Approved" when done, "Rejected" if unusable
   - **Column F (Reviewer Notes)**: Add any comments or questions
   - **Column G-H**: Automatically tracked (don't edit)

## Review Process

### Step 1: Choose What to Review

1. Start with the **UI Translations** sheet (interface text)
2. Then move to **Content** sheets (episode content)
3. Use the **Review Status** sheet to track overall progress

### Step 2: Review Each Translation

For each row:
1. Read the English original (Column B)
2. Read the current translation (Column C)
3. If the translation needs improvement:
   - Click on Column D (Proposed Translation)
   - Type your improved translation
4. Change Status (Column E) to:
   - **Approved** - if the translation is good (with or without your edits)
   - **Rejected** - if the translation is completely wrong
   - Leave as **Pending** - if you're unsure or need to come back

### Step 3: Add Notes When Needed

Use Column F (Reviewer Notes) to:
- Explain why you made changes
- Ask questions about context
- Flag terms that need consistency
- Note if something needs technical review

## Tips for Good Translations

### 1. Understand Context
- The **Path** (Column A) tells you where the text appears
- `home.hero.title` = Homepage hero section title
- `series.jesus-1.episodes.1.title` = Title of episode 1 in Jesus series 1

### 2. Consistency is Key
- Use Ctrl+F (or Cmd+F on Mac) to search for terms
- Keep terminology consistent across the app:
  - "The Urantia Book" → Always translate the same way
  - UI terms like "Play", "Download", "Share" → Use standard translations

### 3. Consider the Medium
- These are podcast descriptions and UI text
- Keep titles concise and engaging
- Summaries should be clear and flowing
- UI text should be short and actionable

### 4. Special Considerations

#### For UI Text:
- Keep it short and clear
- Use imperative mood for buttons ("Reproducir" not "Reproduzca")
- Match the tone (friendly but professional)

#### For Episode Content:
- Maintain the narrative flow
- Keep proper names consistent
- Preserve the meaning while making it natural in your language

## Using Filters and Search

### Filter by Status:
1. Click the filter icon in Column E
2. Uncheck "Approved" to see only pending items
3. This helps focus on what needs review

### Search for Terms:
1. Use Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac)
2. Search across all sheets
3. Ensure consistency for repeated terms

## Viewing Screenshots (If Available)

- Check the **Screenshot Reference** sheet
- Click links to see how pages look in your language
- This helps understand context for UI translations

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "I don't understand what this text is for"
- Check the Path (Column A) for context
- Look at the Screenshot Reference sheet
- Add a note asking for clarification

### "The automated translation is perfect"
- Still change Status to "Approved"
- Leave Proposed Translation empty
- The system will keep the current translation

### "This needs someone else to review"
- Add a note explaining why
- Leave as "Pending"
- The coordinator will assign to appropriate reviewer

## Saving Your Work

- **Changes save automatically** (look for "Saving..." at the top)
- No need to manually save
- You can leave and come back anytime

## When You're Done

1. Review the **Review Status** sheet to see overall progress
2. Let the coordinator know which sections you've completed
3. Ask if there are specific areas to prioritize

## Questions?

- Add questions as notes in Column F
- Email the project coordinator
- The spreadsheet supports real-time collaboration - multiple reviewers can work simultaneously
