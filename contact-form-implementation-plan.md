# Contact Form Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementing a contact form using Resend API in the UBPod project, based on the existing implementation from the reference codebase.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Setup
- [x] Install required dependencies
  - Installed `resend` package
- [x] Create necessary directories
  - Created `src/components/contact`
  - Created `src/utils`
  - Created `src/api`
- [x] Set up environment variables
  - Added Resend API key and email configuration to `.env`
  - Added environment variables to Vercel configuration
- [x] Configure Vercel settings
  - Updated `vercel.json` with API routes and function configuration
  - Added environment variables to Vercel deployment settings

### 2. Core Components
- [x] Create ContactForm component
  - Created `src/pages/ContactPage.tsx` with form fields and validation
  - Implemented file upload handling
  - Added loading and success/error states
- [x] Set up emailService utility
  - Created `src/utils/emailService.ts` for handling email sending
  - Implemented error handling and response types
- [x] Implement API endpoint
  - Created `src/api/send.ts` for processing form submissions
  - Added file attachment handling
  - Implemented Resend API integration
- [x] Add form validation
  - Added required field validation
  - Implemented file size limits
  - Added error messages

### 3. Integration
- [x] Add routing
  - Added Contact page route to `App.tsx`
  - Set up lazy loading for better performance
- [ ] Style to match UBPod design system
- [ ] Test form submission
- [ ] Verify email delivery

### 4. Polish & Testing
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Add success messages
- [ ] Test across browsers

## Progress Log

### March 24, 2024
- Created implementation plan
- Installed Resend package
- Created necessary directories for contact form implementation
- Set up environment variables in `.env` and `vercel.json`
- Created Contact page component with form fields and validation
- Implemented email service utility and API endpoint
- Added routing for the Contact page
- Next step: Style the form to match UBPod's design system

## Notes & Insights
- The implementation will be based on the existing contact form from the reference codebase
- We'll need to adapt the styling to match UBPod's design system
- The form will use Resend API for email delivery
- We'll implement proper error handling and loading states
- Directory structure follows the project's existing patterns
- Environment variables are set up to match the reference implementation
- Vercel configuration includes necessary API routes and function settings
- Form validation includes required fields and file size limits
- API endpoint handles file attachments and email sending
